<h2 id="orga150aa3">TL;DR</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga150aa3">
<p>
Step 1. Pick some endeavor that you do.
</p>

<p>
Step 2. Complete the following analogy:
</p>

<p>
Automatic transmission is to your endeavor as manual transmission is to X.
</p>

<p>
Step 3. If you know how to do X, do it when you can. If you don't know how to do X, learn it.

<h2 id="orgd7ffa3d">Introduction</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgd7ffa3d">
<p>
When I moved to Berlin, I was no longer legally allowed to use my American driver's license after six months. What happens next depends on what state you have your driver's license in. For some states, you can simply trade your license in for a German one. For some states, you have to take the German written test. For some states (like California, where I'm from), you have to take both the written and practical test again. This meant I had to go to German driving school and do the whole process, as if I was 16 again. While this was annoying, I took this as an opportunity to do something I had always wanted to do: learn how to drive stick.
</p>

<p>
Driving stick is a very different experience than automatic. I was learning on an old car that did not have any special features (eg. to make hill starts easier). It was just me, the engine, and the controls. This on top of driving in one of Europe's biggest cities. For reference I originally learned in the suburbs of Sacramento, California.
</p>

<p>
All this being said, I ended up loving driving stick. I felt like I had more control over the car. I felt more connected to the engine and the inner workings. There were more things I had to track. I had to be more engaged at all times. This in turn made me a better driver on the road, perhaps because I was more focused on the task of driving as opposed to whatever else is on the day's checklist.
</p>

<p>
From a practical standpoint, automatics get the job done and are often more environmentally friendly (eg. hybrids, electrics). But manual transmission crystalized a mindset that is going to be the subject of this post. In short: for a lot of things I do, there is the "automatic" version and the "stick" version. The automatic version is what I use when I need to get the job done on some deadline. The stick version is what I use when I have a bit more time and I want to invest in improving my craft, innovating, or when I just want the feeling of self-reliance and connectedness to my craft that I crave increasingly as I get older.

<h2 id="orgf9631d4">Generalizing stick shift</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf9631d4">
<p>
The best way to get at what I'm talking about is to simply provide examples from my life. There is a lot of overlap with other concepts, like do-it-yourself (DIY), and producing rather than consuming.
</p>

<p>
Below is a list of examples that highlight what I mean by Stick Shift Mindset. My plan is to simply add to this list over time as I acquire or realize more and more examples. 
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5490136" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org5490136">Windows/OSX versus the command line</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5490136">
<p>
I have a Mac, and I've been using Macs since 2009 or so. Prior to that, I was on Windows machines. I spend a lot of my time clicking around to get where I want to be.
</p>

<p>
However, when I started learning programming in the mid-2010s, I started using the command line more. At first it was cumbersome, but then I started learning the keybindings, learning Vim and Emacs (more on this later), and learning how to make shell scripts to do much more complex tasks. Now, in many respects I'm more productive on the command line than I am clicking around. I don't exclusively use the command line, of course. But when I do, <b>I feel like I'm one layer more connected to the computer</b>, just as I feel when I'm driving stick. In many ways, I'm much more effective doing mundane tasks on the computer now that I use the command line more than I click around.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org723a72f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org723a72f">MS Word versus Emacs Org Mode</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org723a72f">
<p>
I used to write most of my files in Microsoft Word. It's simple, and it gets the job done. I wrote my PhD thesis and my manuscripts in grad school all in Word. I had also written my journal entires in Word since 2009.
</p>

<p>
However, I discovered Emacs in the past two years. In particular, Emacs <a href="https://orgmode.org/index.html">Org Mode</a> (now available on other platforms), which most of my writing is in these days, is plain text with a ton of additional features written in Lisp. All of it is open source and fully customizable. If you're not satisfied with something, then you can write an extension yourself and contribute to the community accordingly. People talk about the steep learning curve, but if you just focus on the thing you need it to do right now, then it's not that bad. Accordingly, I found that I was able to do a lot more with my writing in Org. Importantly, <b>I felt like I was one layer more connected to my work by using Org than I was when I was using Word</b>. I moved all my journal entries over, wrote my website in Org, and even code in Org from time to time.
</p>

<p>
As a caveat, I often need to write something with a very tight deadline or I need to do a group project or something where Word, Google Docs, Notion, or something like that is simply the better choice. That's fine. But if there are no major constraints, I'm going to use Org Mode.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org1e67be1" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org1e67be1">IDE versus Vim and Emacs</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1e67be1">
<p>
This is a tricky one. When it comes to complex tasks and group projects, I code in Visual Studio. This might be because I simply haven't gotten good enough at Vim and Emacs to justify its full time use.
</p>

<p>
However, I find myself coding in Emacs when I'm doing hobby projects and Vim when I'm on the command line and need to quickly go into a file. When I'm using Vim and Emacs, <b>I feel more connected to the computer</b> and even if I'm not as productive, it seems to get me into the right mindset for innovation and creativity.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgcf40f80" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgcf40f80">Restaurant/ordering versus cooking</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgcf40f80">
<p>
Now for something that is more relatable to non-tech people. When I was in grad school, I often ate at a restaurant next door to my apartment for the sake of efficiency. There was always something I had to do with some tough deadline that I was behind on. So Ray's Grill at Stanford was the lowest hanging fruit.
</p>

<p>
However, in the second half of grad school, I started working on my culinary skills. It didn't take long before I had a handful of dishes that I could make. Especially now, when I eat at a restaurant or order food, I can notice the sheer volume of salt, fat and sugar added to the food to optimize taste sufficient to maximize profit. I notice this only because I go for long periods of time where I just cook at home, and my semi-cynical capitalist take comes from the fact that I own a business so I understand the mindset.
</p>

<p>
Importantly, when I see all the ingredients of my dinner on the kitchen counter and I know how they're going to combine and be modified at what temperatures for how long, <b>I feel more connected to what I eat and drink</b>. I think this is very important as I get older and it gets easier to gain weight and harder to lose weight.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org82d7eaa" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org82d7eaa">Playing music versus improvising music</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org82d7eaa">
<p>
I have always been a fan of music. In particular, I like jazz. One of the main reasons for this is because I played bass in jazz bands and jazz combos from junior high school through college. Now, I'm learning jazz piano.
</p>

<p>
What is important about jazz music is that it's not enough to play the right notes for a given song. You have to embody the spirit of the song sufficient to play new music in the style of the song, on the fly. That's what solos are.
</p>

<p>
When I improvise over a song, be it on the bass or on the piano, <b>I feel more connected to the music and the instrument</b>. This is one reason why I love jazz music. Yes, it sounds great. Yes, it's fun to play. But it completely changes your mindset too. You look at a song not as a thing to be memorized, but as a spirit to be embodied. I'll probably write an article on just this topic at some point down the line.

<div id="outline-container-org072007c" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org072007c">Being employed versus being self employed</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org072007c">
<p>
At the end of graduate school, I started consulting for biotech companies to make a bit of extra money. After I graduated, I was employed half time as a computational biologist and I was consulting half time. I was successful enough with the latter that I made the rational decision to do consulting full time. A few years after that, I turned my freelance operation into a GmbH (German LLC, but with shares and no pass-through income).
</p>

<p>
Being self employed is hard. There is no guarantee you're going to get paid next month. I've gone through phases where my profits are through the roof, and phases where I'm making pennies. These two modes, feast and famine, can switch at the drop of a hat. The market moves, and some of my products and services become outdated, automated, crowded, or any number of things that force me to adapt. There are no severence packages. Clients can terminate the agreement with a few days notice.
</p>

<p>
However, <b>being self employed has made me feel more connected to the economy and capitalism in general</b>. This has been very valuable in terms of understanding things like how markets work, what value actually is, what my value actually is (either they buy or they don't), and what incentive structures are moving us around. The last one comes with a warning. Without going too far into it, my self employed friends and I really do not want to go back into employment. When you see employment from an external perspective, you'll know what I mean.

<h2 id="org9b2093b">Conclusion</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org9b2093b">
<p>
Each of the examples in this article highlight a particular process, that goes something like this:
</p>

<p>
Step 1. Pick some endeavor that you do.
</p>

<p>
Step 2. Complete the following analogy:
</p>

<p>
Automatic transmission is to your endeavor as manual transmission is to X.
</p>

<p>
Step 3. If you know how to do X, do it when you can. If you don't know how to do X, learn it.
</p>

<p>
I'm not going to pretend I am perfect at this process. Like many of the things I write, this article is a way to remind me to adhere to this process and to embody the Stick Shift Mindset when I can.
</p>

<p>
In today's world, I can't cook every meal, most cars down the line will be hybrid or electric (automatic transmission), Visual Studio is easier and faster than Emacs (at least for me), tools like Notion have a lot of advantages over tools like Org Mode, and I might come across employment opportunities down the line that I can't refuse.
</p>

<p>
However, the general concept of being more connected to all my endeavors has made me more competent, self-reliant, creative, innovative, interesting, has led to more friendships, and has made my life more meaningful in general. So call up your car enthusiast friend with the manual transmission, go to an empty parking lot, and get in gear.
