<h2 id="org62c872a">About me</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org62c872a">
<p>
<a href="./meditations_chapter_one.html">I</a> am an American CEO and computational biologist who lives in Berlin, Germany. I am best known for my work on knowledge graphs, the limits of dimension reduction algorithms, and single-cell analysis with respect to the many applications of K-Nearest Neighbors. 
</p>

<p>
I run a company called <a href="https://burnslsc.com/">Burns Life Sciences Consulting, GmbH</a>, which allows me to practice open science, work on diverse projects with many organizations, and develop and sell products. The problem is most of my work is behind NDAs so I can't talk about it. There is another large amount of my work that is unpublished, simply because being a CEO has a lot of demands that don't give me the time.
</p>

<p>
This website is a place where I can openly share my ideas and non-client work, regardless of how "finished" it is. I have uploaded written work, code, posters and powerpoint slides of various projects I have driven or contributed to. I intend for a lot of my work here to be "long content" slowly evolving over years if not decades. What matters most is that my thoughts and the work I do that I find meaningful is uploaded here, so when I die (hopefully way down the line) others can easily build off of any worthwhile groundwork I have laid out. 
</p>

<p>
If you have quesitons or comments, or you're interested in working or collaborating with me, just send me a message (see contact info below). I'm always happy to help.

<p>
There is a renewed interest in Stoic philosophy as of late. It's a great set of tools that I have used for dealing with hardship. But it's 2000 years old. Where are the modern Stoics? They exist, but under a different name: psychotherapists. If psychotherapy was the successor to Stoicism, and there is so much interest in Stoicism, then shouldn't there be an equal amount of interest in clinical psychology and how it can help us? Shouldn't it be something we learn early, and make these tools part of our daily routine, as the Stoics do?

<p>
Plato and the Greek philosophers valued learning geometry as a means to understand and think about the world, despite not using it for practical purposes (like engineering). I see computer science as geometry for modern philosophy. This matters because I think one should still learn the basics of how to code even if AI automates all of it in the future. Even the first few months of computer science drastically helped me improve my thinking.

Finding truth in the real world is much different than finding truth in grad school. Grad school had me working on non-controversial, dry topics that few people in the world worked on. The real world is a lot messier. I talk about the idea of collecting opposing perspectives, steelmanning them, and putting them in dielectic to find higher truth. It's simple in theory, but hard in practice.

<p>
One of the key components to my method of solving problems is to get into the flow state. When I'm there, some or all of the problem at hand solves itself. And it feels great. I show examples of me doing this. I talk about Taoism as an ancient philosophy built around flow state, but at the macro level rather than the "within-game" level. This is the ideal of being in a perpetual flow state that lasts one's entire lifetime.

This is the idea that data visualizations that look prettier than others don't necessarily convey more truth. I use SPADE and t-SNE as examples that can produce this delusion.

My current plan for coming economic uncertainty we face in the near term due to the recession, and for uncertainty that wil persist beyond the recession (eg. AI disruption).

This is helping me be more effective, and figure out unique new ways I can add value to the world.

A heuristic that helps me innovate by being more connected to the internals of what I'm doing. Pick an endeavor. Complete the analogy: automatic transmission is to your endeavor as manual transmission is to X. If you know how to do X, do it when you can. If you don't know how to do X, then learn it. I give several examples of this in my life, and I conclude by encouraging others to embody this mindset.

I turn the Meditations by Marcus Aurelius into a semantic search based language model, where I ask a question and it returns the most relevant passages in the book as answers.

In the age of big data, my bioinformatics analyses often lead to output that is still too much for a human to extract insight from. My use case here, common in my work: what GWAS traits do two or more genes have in common? I produce a context map of GWAS traits using an AI language model based on BERT. I then subset the map by traits associated with the genes the user inputs, coloring the points accordingly. One can quickly know what contexts, rather than traits, the genes share.

I explore this option using my early access to GPT-3, with a conclusion heavily inspired by an article by <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3#weaknesses">Gwern</a>.

The scientific literature is overwhelming, and knowing how to utilize text mining and analytic tools can help you efficiently get what you want out of a literature search. Here, I utilize the PubMed API to find publication rates for particular topics. I show that among other things, single-cell sequencing began out-pacing mass cytometry in 2016. Insight like this helps you see how crowded a field is and especially identify trends.

Understanding how authors of a given field are connected can help you identify key individuals to pay attention to.

In this article, focusing on mass cytometry, I identify two types of thought leaders: one exclusive to a particular sub-domain, and one who spans across multiple sub-domains. It is important to know both types when approaching a new topic.

As such, I spent a lot of time adjusting inputs (eg. number of cells) and parameters (eg. perplexity) to understand how that affects the resulting map.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org18929c2">
<p>
Abstract: In high-dimensional single cell data, comparing changes in functional markers between conditions is typically done across manual or algorithm-derived partitions based on population-defining markers. Visualizations of these partitions is commonly done on low-dimensional embeddings (eg. t-SNE), colored by per-partition changes. Here, we provide an analysis and visualization tool that performs these comparisons across overlapping k-nearest neighbor (KNN) groupings. This allows one to color low-dimensional embeddings by marker changes without hard boundaries imposed by partitioning. We devised an objective optimization of k based on minimizing functional marker KNN imputation error. Proof-of-concept work visualized the exact location of an IL-7 responsive subset in a B cell developmental trajectory on a t-SNE map independent of clustering. Per-condition cell frequency analysis revealed that KNN is sensitive to detecting artifacts due to marker shift, and therefore can also be valuable in a quality control pipeline. Overall, we found that KNN groupings lead to useful multiple condition visualizations and efficiently extract a large amount of information from mass cytometry data. Our software is publicly available through the Bioconductor package Sconify.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org55ede8e">
<p>
Abstract: To quantify visual and spatial information in single cells with a throughput of thousands of cells per second, we developed Subcellular Localization Assay (SLA). This adaptation of Proximity Ligation Assay expands the capabilities of flow cytometry to include data relating to localization of proteins to and within organelles. We used SLA to detect the nuclear import of transcription factors across cell subsets in complex samples. We further measured intranuclear re-localization of target proteins across the cell cycle and upon DNA damage induction. SLA combines multiple single-cell methods to bring about a new dimension of inquiry and analysis in complex cell populations. © 2017 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.

In sum: I started by developing a method to enable flow and mass cytometry to detect and quantify nuclear localization, called Subcellular Localization Assay (SLA), which came out of a collaboration with the lab of Ola Soederberg at University of Uppsala, Sweden.

<p>
In parallel, I was taking computer science classes as a side hobby. I reached a point where I was trying to compare two t-SNE maps between unstimulated and simulated data, and I realized that there was a K-Nearest Neighbors based solution that I could implement with my newfoud computer science competencies. I therefore developed Sconify, a now BioConductor package that allows for these visualizations. There were many use cases, and I spent the remainder of my thesis developing this method further and doing various collaborations with it.

German CyTOF User Forum; Berlin, Germany; January 2020.
In this talk, I measured the accurracy of dimension reduction tools (PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP) in terms of their nearest neighbor overlap. This is the k-nearest neighbors of a given cell in the original high dimension space, in comparison to the k-nearest neighbors of a given cell in the embedding. I show that the overlap here is much lower than my audience expected. I've given this talk many times since then, for my clients.

This slide deck summarizes some work I did with Sofie Van Gassen, developer of <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/FlowSOM.html">FlowSOM</a> and all-around awesome person. We were looking at what is called the U-Matrix, a way to visualize the self organizing maps that FlowSOM produces. The question was what insights could we derive from using the U-Matrix to visualize the output of very large FlowSOM clusterings (eg. a 100 x 100 grid rather than the default 10 x 10). So far as I know, this is not explored in any major CyTOF publication, so any CyTOF users who use FlowSOM (most people at the time of writing) should have a look at this. There are visualizations in here that are useful but remain unpublished.

Invited Speaker, German CyTOF User Forum; Berlin, Germany; February 2018.
This is the talk version of my 2018 Sconify paper, that ended up being the final chapter of my PhD thesis. There are two aspects to this talk. The first is making visual comparisons of unstimulated and stimulated CyTOF data when looking at measurements of phosphoproteins. This was easily done on SPADE trees, but not t-SNE maps, until I started making k-nearest neighbor based comparisons. The second aspect of this talk is using the same nearest neighbor based comparisons to investigate batch effects in CyTOF data. I note that batch effects were only heavily discussed among CyTOF users starting near 2020 (in my circles), and this work goes back to 2016.

CYTO Conference; Prague, Czech Republic; May 2018.
Abstract: Due to the rise of high-dimensional single cell technologies in the past few years, there has been an increasing number of both computational methods and workflows to analyze the new wealth of data. However, non-intuitive properties of high-dimensional space can give rise to analysis artifacts, collectively known of as the “curse of dimensionality.” Increasing dimensions differentially affect the performance of distance metrics, and there is no clear consensus about which distance metrics to use for which analysis strategies. While the influence of many tool-specific parameters has been evaluated, we study here the impact of commonly used distance metrics on the outcome of dimensionality reduction and clustering.

A wrapper I wrote around the <a href="https://anders-biostat.github.io/sleepwalk/">sleepwalk</a> R package. Hover the cursor over any cell in your embedding, and it will show you the cell's k-nearest neighbors computed from the original feature space (as opposed to the embedding space). This allows you to test your assumptions around how exact a low-dimensional embedding (eg. t-SNE, UMAP) is.

Official description: This package does k-nearest neighbor based statistics and visualizations with flow and mass cytometery data. This gives tSNE maps"fold change" functionality and provides a data quality metric by assessing manifold overlap between fcs files expected to be the same. Other applications using this package include imputation, marker redundancy, and testing the relative information loss of lower dimension embeddings compared to the original manifold.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbbc1d77">

These are primarily R and python markdowns exploring various topics. I apologize if the one you're reading is a bit messy. Most of these are instances of me just tinkering for the sake of tinkering. These often lead to interesting results that I don't have time to follow up on, but I figure that showing unpolished work is better than showing no work. If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to contact me. Anything that gets attention here will trigger me to work on it.
</p>

<p>
There are two potenital audiences here. The first are those with questions about any of the topics below that I cover. The second are those learning coding or data science who want to see examples of simple but insightful analyses.

Regardless of the reader's intent, I hope above all that the work below will encourage people to really tinker with text, numbers, and data. You can get surprisingly far if you get in the habit of it.

<p>
Some examples of output for my <a href="https://github.com/tjburns08/knn_sleepwalk">KNN sleepwalk tool</a>. These are interactive, and are here to give the user intuition around the nature of dimension reduction maps. From the README: "My wrapper allows for the visualization of a given cell's K-nearest (and K-farthest) neighbors. In other words, the cursor is on a given cell, and the cells on the map that change color correspond to a pre-specified number of nearest neighbors in the original high-dimensional space." See notebooks in my repo to see the data and code. What to do with the visuals below:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>K-nearest neighbors (KNN) will give you intuition around how exact the embedding is.</li>
<li>K-farthest neighbors (KFN) will give you intuition around how well the embedding preserves global structure.</li>

Which distance metrics are right for your data analysis. While I've created a poster on this <a href="https://tjburns08.github.io/final_distance.project.poster.pdf">here</a>, this is a stab at it from a different direction. I make synthetic CyTOF-like data, varying the dimensionality from 2 to 1000. I make a distance matrix for each distance metric used, and then correlate each one to that of the Euclidean distance matrix, which is often a default. The results are counter-intuitive.

<p>
What are the fundamental units of a computer? Logic gates. I show what these are. I then show that they can be created with combinations of a single type of logic gate: NAND (Not AND). In other words, you can make a general-purpose computer if you had enough NAND gates and wires. In the spirit of this, I combine NAND gates to create a calculator that can add large numbers. One of the key points in this exercise is that it does not take much to get from NAND gates to complex computations.

If you want the means of your markers per cluster, be careful how you export the data. If you export the means of the raw values per cluster, and take the asinh(x/5) transform of that, the values will be different than if you take the means of the asinh(x/5) transformed data per cluster. The latter is the right way to do it. But don't take my word for it. Look at the markdown yourself.

You are only as good as the questions you ask yourself and others. My uncle told me that many years ago when I was getting started with my career and it stuck. This has been relevant to me in terms of having and maintaining good friendships, being a good husband, being a good family member, being a good businessman, and when I was in graduate school, being a good scientist, and simply being an interesting person. I have a very large list of questions now that is very overwhelming. So I turned them into an embedding using the BERT language model, turned that into a nearest neighbor graph, and then derived insight from looking at the questions in terms of "communities."
