<p>
<a href="./meditations_chapter_one.html">I</a> am an American CEO and computational biologist who lives in Berlin, Germany. I am best known for my 12 years of work in the single-cell field, and more recently, my work in biosecurity. I am informally known for my passion for fitness, which gives me the balance and energy to do the rest of the work.
</p>

<p>
I run a company called <a href="./burns_lsc.html">Burns Life Sciences Consulting, GmbH</a>, which allows me to impact many more individuals and organizations than I otherwise could as an employee. The problem is most of my work is behind NDAs so I can't talk about it. There is another large amount of my work that is unpublished, simply because running a company has a lot of demands that don't give me the time.
</p>

<p>
This website is a place where I can openly share my ideas and non-NDA work, regardless of how "finished" it is. I have uploaded written work, code, posters and powerpoint slides of various projects I have driven or contributed to. I intend for a lot of my work here to be "long content" slowly evolving over years if not decades. What matters most is that my thoughts and the work I do that I find meaningful is uploaded here, so when I die (hopefully way down the line) others can easily build off of any worthwhile groundwork I have laid out.

<p>
In the world of atoms, we have distinct fields of science that follow specific levels of analysis. Math leads to physics, then chemistry, biology, psychology, and sociology. But right now computer science is one single thing. But perhaps down the line, computer science will divide into distinct fields depending on levels of analysis too. From information theory, upwards to programming languages, algorithms, AI/ML, agentic AI psychology, and bot net sociology. This has implications for what it means when you tell a biology they should "learn how to code," with further implications in recruiting, problem solving, and education.

</p>

<p>
When clustering single-cell or spatial data, there is a built-in assumption that the clusters are final. That a CD4 T cell at a CD4/CD8 boundary is nonetheless a CD4 T cell. This may not be the case every time. Here, I developed a simple way to identify and interrogate these boundary regions. I do this by taking each cell's k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and calculating the Shannon entropy of each neighborhood. Zero entropy means you're in the thicket of a cluster. Higher entropy means you are at a boundary region.
</p>

<p>
At the per-cell level, you can interrogate these cells or factor this score into downstream analyses (e.g. ML algorithms). At the per-cluster level, you can calcualte a purity score based on the mean KNN entropy for each cell in the given cluster. This has applications like determining whether clusters should be merged.

To give credit where credit is due, I talk about the MEM paper (Diggins et al, 2018). In the interview, I say that this paper algorithmically gives you a way to determine a gating strategy given a cluster. I'll correct that here and say that the MEM paper is able to convert clusters into descriptions of what markers are positive and negative. Later work, like hypergate (Becht et al, 2019), and gatefinder (Aghaeepour et al, 2018) do the algorithmic gating strategy maker step.

<p>
Clustering is a critical piece of any single-cell analysis workflow, be it suspension or spatial, transcript or protein. But after clusters have been computed, how sure is any given user that the clusters most accurrately represent cell subset partitions? Are there any element of arbitrariness of a given clustering scheme? One way to get at that question is to run your clustering algorithm multiple times across multiple random seeds, and look at how similar any one scheme is to the others by stringing the cluster visualizations (in this case, the cluster centroids) together into an animation. Here, we do this with the PBMC 3k dataset and standard Louvain clustering. We show that some subsets are less stable than others, and stability will differ based on what resolution you choose for your clustering scheme.

The typical way LLMs are called is through some sort of user interface. Here, I show you how to use the OpenRouter API to call various LLMs (eg. Claude, Deepseek R1, GPT-4o) by simply typing "chatbot" in the command line, followed by the desired model, followed by the prompt. It can be called from anywhere on your computer.

<p>
A typical single-cell sequencing pipeline involves clustering the data, and then using prior biological knowledge to annotate the clusters given unique marker expression. Here, I develop a workflow that calls a LLM directly in R, with a pre-specified prompt, to annotate the PBMC 3k data, storing the results as an R object, directly in a Seurat workflow, in R. I then run it multiple times to check for stabiity of the annotations. I find that it annotates the PBMC 3k dataset accurrately, with subtle errors (eg. not going deep enough in the naming of a subset) likely able to be overcome by prompt engineering and/or model selection.

<p>
At the time of writing (February 2025) I am frustrated by the best of the LLMs giving me results that are still in my opinion superficial. So I wrote a script that would prompt a LLM to give me an answer on something, and then with each iteration in a loop, take a piece of the answer and go deeper into it. I thought it would either converge upon something fundamental, or continually drift into different topics. I was wrong on both. The model eventually descended into emoji-laden verse, and then word salad, and then a sort of letter salad, where it started making up words, disregarding grammar, and so forth. Something like E. E. Cummings. I encourage the reader to try it on their machine.

<p>
In my client projects, I often have to make sense of long lists of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). This typically leads to a long list of biologically relevant terms (eg. GO terms, pathways). This too is often overwhelming. Here, I make these terms easier to understand by producing a interactive contextual map of them, where terms that are similar to each other in context are physically near each other on the map. In this R Markdown, I show you both how its done, using python's sentence-transformers package directly in R. Furthermore, I cluster the map and show you how to automatically annotate the clusters by feeding the per-cluster terms into a LLM directly in R, and asking it to return an underlying theme for each cluster given the terms.

<p>
When using "color" as a dimension (for example, coloring UMAPs by marker expression), flow cytometry users often default to the "jet" color palette, and Seurat users often default to their default light-gray to blue color palette. Here, I present the case for the use of viridis as a default color palette. I show that viridis is more balanced and colorblind friendly than jet, with more resolution than the Seurat default. Using this color scheme will be beneficial for both data interpretation and inclusivity in our field.

<p>
What happens when you omit PCA from a Seurat scRNA-seq pipeline? Here, Using the flagship pre-annotated PBMC 3k dataset, I tested this by inputting the top 2000 variable genes directly into UMAP, bypassing PCA. The results showed less spatially resolved subsets, particularly among CD4 T cells. Furthermore, I found that in the no-PCA condition, performance (measured by how well cell subsets could be resolved) was substantially worse when using Euclidean distance rather than cosine distance. These differences went away when the top 10 PCs were used as input (which again is standard best practices). These results suggest that in this context, the choice of distance metric matters more in higher dimensions. Thus, I recommend defaulting to cosine distance or testing both metrics side by side when using UMAP or similar tools on high-dimensional datasets.

Universal Cell Embeddings (UCE) is a foundation model that takes a single-cell dataset as input and outputs a 1280 dimensional embedding that is relevant in the context of a large number of single-cell datasets that it was trained on. This model can in turn do things like label transfer between datasets. Here, I looked at the embedding within the PBMC 3k dataset and simply asked how many k-nearest neighbors per cell are shared between the original dataset and its UCE embedding. Specifically, I used the first 50 PCs of the PBMC 3k dataset's top 2000 most variable genes (standard practice), and the first 50 PCs of the UCE model. The results suggest that nearest neighbors are preserved at the labeled cell subset level but the resolution does not go beyond this. Note: I also compared the first 50 PCs of the PBMC 3k dataset with the entire 1280 dimensions of the UCE output, and the results were slightly worse but similar.

What happens under the hood when you do something simple in R, like add two numbers together? Here, I start with just that. I then show that arithmetic in R is actually parsed as S-expressions. I then go into LISP, where S-expressions are a hallmark. I then move into the source code of R, where the S-expressions for arithmetic are written, in C. And from there, I go into Assembly, the human-readable version of machine code that C is compiled into. By breaking down these layers, and going down the rabbit hole, this exercise gets us to first principles. These are foundational concepts from which we can reason and solve problems more effectively.

<p>
In a standard single cell RNA sequencing analysis pipeline, one of the first things you do is find and use only the most variable genes, as measured by gene expression and dispersion. These variable genes are sufficient to be used in downstream analysis, like clustering and dimensionality reduction. Here, I test whether I can do the same thing for the Universal Cell Embeddings (UCE) foundation model, which in theory could save time and compute. I find that running only the variable genes through UCE leads to poorer cell type separation, as measured by both UMAP and PCA. This suggests that those who use UCE should use the full datasets, not filtered ones.

In this markdown, we import two PBMC datasets, the PBMC 3k and the PBMC 10k datasets. The 3k dataset is a flagship dataset used in the early days of Seurat. The 10k dataset is the default that is run through the model if you don't specify another dataset. Here, I show that if we look at a UMAP embedding, the datasets do not sit on top of each other. However, if we use my KnnSleepwalk package, we find that the distances on the UMAP are distorted. What we find is that, for example, the T cell island for the 3k datset sits much closer to the T cell island for the 10k dataset. This in turn suggests that we should be careful using UMAP to assess foundation models in single-cell and in any field.

This is a jupyter notebook that looks at the Universal Cell Embeddings transformer foundation model for single-cell sequencing. It is part of an emerging sub-field of foundation model building within single-cell sequencing. The output of the model is a 1280 dimensional embedding. Here, to get a sense of the geometry of the embedding, I look at the center and the outer edges. I visualize this in the context of UMAP space, and find that UMAP does not properly capture center-ness. I further find that center-ness is positively associated with both frequency of cell subset and per-subset density. I conclude that center-ness is a worthwhile feature to look at in the context of these models, and that it is not something that UMAP can be relied upon to capture.

In essence, when I come across something that feels like its part of the path forward, but can't fully articulate why, I say "there's some signal there" and then I put it in my back pocket. This essay tells the story of how doing this from my teenage years onwards, has contributed to a lot of my good decisions thus far.

<p>
This webinar is the latest iteration of my "dimensionality reduction interrogation" work, which has spanned six years. In this talk, I show the limits of these tools by looking at the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) of a given cell in the 2-D embedding space, and compare it to the K-nearest neighbors of that same cell in the high-dimensional feature space. I look at the averages across a given dataset for a given method to compare t-SNE, UMAP and PCA. I then color the maps by each cell's KNN preservation to look for patterns across the dataset. While I point out some general trends, I conclude that at least some of this depends on the dataset. Thus, I demo my free <a href="https://github.com/tjburns08/KnnSleepwalk">KnnSleepwalk</a> tool, which allows users to deterine the performance of their t-SNE's and UMAPs for their data accordingly.

<p>
In flow cytometry and CyTOF analysis, we distinguish between "type" and "state" markers, so we can cluster on the former and analyze per-cluster expression changes in the latter. For single-cell RNA sequencing, we cannot make this distinguishment. Thus, we have to rely on data integration algorithms when we are analyzing pre-treatment and post-treatment datasets. I show how this is done, and I show how failure to do so can lead research teams to falsely interpret the data, and make false conclusions. Thus, understanding data integration is critical to keeping research teams on track.

<p>
When clustering single-cell or spatial data, there is a built-in assumption that the clusters are final. That a CD4 T cell at a CD4/CD8 boundary is nonetheless a CD4 T cell. This may not be the case every time. Here, I developed a simple way to identify and interrogate these boundary regions. I do this by taking each cell's k-nearest neighbors (KNN) and calculating the Shannon entropy of each neighborhood. Zero entropy means you're in the thicket of a cluster. Higher entropy means you are at a boundary region.
</p>

<p>
At the per-cell level, you can interrogate these cells or factor this score into downstream analyses (e.g. ML algorithms). At the per-cluster level, you can calcualte a purity score based on the mean KNN entropy for each cell in the given cluster. This has applications like determining whether clusters should be merged.

<p>
Clustering is a critical piece of any single-cell analysis workflow, be it suspension or spatial, transcript or protein. But after clusters have been computed, how sure is any given user that the clusters most accurrately represent cell subset partitions? Are there any element of arbitrariness of a given clustering scheme? One way to get at that question is to run your clustering algorithm multiple times across multiple random seeds, and look at how similar any one scheme is to the others by stringing the cluster visualizations (in this case, the cluster centroids) together into an animation. Here, we do this with the PBMC 3k dataset and standard Louvain clustering. We show that some subsets are less stable than others, and stability will differ based on what resolution you choose for your clustering scheme.

<p>
A typical single-cell sequencing pipeline involves clustering the data, and then using prior biological knowledge to annotate the clusters given unique marker expression. Here, I develop a workflow that calls a LLM directly in R, with a pre-specified prompt, to annotate the PBMC 3k data, storing the results as an R object, directly in a Seurat workflow, in R. I then run it multiple times to check for stabiity of the annotations. I find that it annotates the PBMC 3k dataset accurrately, with subtle errors (eg. not going deep enough in the naming of a subset) likely able to be overcome by prompt engineering and/or model selection.

<p>
When using "color" as a dimension (for example, coloring UMAPs by marker expression), flow cytometry users often default to the "jet" color palette, and Seurat users often default to their default light-gray to blue color palette. Here, I present the case for the use of viridis as a default color palette. I show that viridis is more balanced and colorblind friendly than jet, with more resolution than the Seurat default. Using this color scheme will be beneficial for both data interpretation and inclusivity in our field.

<p>
What happens when you omit PCA from a Seurat scRNA-seq pipeline? Here, Using the flagship pre-annotated PBMC 3k dataset, I tested this by inputting the top 2000 variable genes directly into UMAP, bypassing PCA. The results showed less spatially resolved subsets, particularly among CD4 T cells. Furthermore, I found that in the no-PCA condition, performance (measured by how well cell subsets could be resolved) was substantially worse when using Euclidean distance rather than cosine distance. These differences went away when the top 10 PCs were used as input (which again is standard best practices). These results suggest that in this context, the choice of distance metric matters more in higher dimensions. Thus, I recommend defaulting to cosine distance or testing both metrics side by side when using UMAP or similar tools on high-dimensional datasets.

<p>
Universal Cell Embeddings (UCE) is a foundation model that takes a single-cell dataset as input and outputs a 1280 dimensional embedding that is relevant in the context of a large number of single-cell datasets that it was trained on. This model can in turn do things like label transfer between datasets. Here, I looked at the embedding within the PBMC 3k dataset and simply asked how many k-nearest neighbors per cell are shared between the original dataset and its UCE embedding. Specifically, I used the first 50 PCs of the PBMC 3k dataset's top 2000 most variable genes (standard practice), and the first 50 PCs of the UCE model. The results suggest that nearest neighbors are preserved at the labeled cell subset level but the resolution does not go beyond this. Note: I also compared the first 50 PCs of the PBMC 3k dataset with the entire 1280 dimensions of the UCE output, and the results were slightly worse but similar.

<p>
In a standard single cell RNA sequencing analysis pipeline, one of the first things you do is find and use only the most variable genes, as measured by gene expression and dispersion. These variable genes are sufficient to be used in downstream analysis, like clustering and dimensionality reduction. Here, I test whether I can do the same thing for the Universal Cell Embeddings (UCE) foundation model, which in theory could save time and compute. I find that running only the variable genes through UCE leads to poorer cell type separation, as measured by both UMAP and PCA. This suggests that those who use UCE should use the full datasets, not filtered ones.

In this markdown, we import two PBMC datasets, the PBMC 3k and the PBMC 10k datasets. The 3k dataset is a flagship dataset used in the early days of Seurat. The 10k dataset is the default that is run through the model if you don't specify another dataset. Here, I show that if we look at a UMAP embedding, the datasets do not sit on each other. However, if we use my KnnSleepwalk package, we find that the distances on the UMAP are distorted. What we find is that, for example, the T cell island for the 3k datset sits much closer to the T cell island for the 10k dataset. This in turn suggests that we should be careful using UMAP to assess foundation models in single-cell and in any field.

This is a jupyter notebook that looks at the Universal Cell Embeddings transformer foundation model for single-cell sequencing. It is part of an emerging sub-field of foundation model building within single-cell sequencing. The output of the model is a 1280 dimensional embedding. Here, to get a sense of the geometry of the embedding, I look at the center and the outer edges. I visualize this in the context of UMAP space, and find that UMAP does not properly capture center-ness. I further find that center-ness is positively associated with both frequency of cell subset and per-subset density. I conclude that center-ness is a worthwhile feature to look at in the context of these models, and that it is not something that UMAP can be relied upon to capture.

Abstract: In high-dimensional single cell data, comparing changes in functional markers between conditions is typically done across manual or algorithm-derived partitions based on population-defining markers. Visualizations of these partitions is commonly done on low-dimensional embeddings (eg. t-SNE), colored by per-partition changes. Here, we provide an analysis and visualization tool that performs these comparisons across overlapping k-nearest neighbor (KNN) groupings. This allows one to color low-dimensional embeddings by marker changes without hard boundaries imposed by partitioning. We devised an objective optimization of k based on minimizing functional marker KNN imputation error. Proof-of-concept work visualized the exact location of an IL-7 responsive subset in a B cell developmental trajectory on a t-SNE map independent of clustering. Per-condition cell frequency analysis revealed that KNN is sensitive to detecting artifacts due to marker shift, and therefore can also be valuable in a quality control pipeline. Overall, we found that KNN groupings lead to useful multiple condition visualizations and efficiently extract a large amount of information from mass cytometry data. Our software is publicly available through the Bioconductor package Sconify.

Abstract: To quantify visual and spatial information in single cells with a throughput of thousands of cells per second, we developed Subcellular Localization Assay (SLA). This adaptation of Proximity Ligation Assay expands the capabilities of flow cytometry to include data relating to localization of proteins to and within organelles. We used SLA to detect the nuclear import of transcription factors across cell subsets in complex samples. We further measured intranuclear re-localization of target proteins across the cell cycle and upon DNA damage induction. SLA combines multiple single-cell methods to bring about a new dimension of inquiry and analysis in complex cell populations. © 2017 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.

<p>
In sum: I started by developing a method to enable flow and mass cytometry to detect and quantify nuclear localization, called Subcellular Localization Assay (SLA), which came out of a collaboration with the lab of Ola Soederberg at University of Uppsala, Sweden.

<p>
In parallel, I was taking computer science classes as a side hobby. I reached a point where I was trying to compare two t-SNE maps between unstimulated and simulated data, and I realized that there was a K-Nearest Neighbors based solution that I could implement with my newfoud computer science competencies. I therefore developed Sconify, a now BioConductor package that allows for these visualizations. There were many use cases, and I spent the remainder of my thesis developing this method further and doing various collaborations with it.

German CyTOF User Forum; Berlin, Germany; January 2020.
In this talk, I measured the accurracy of dimension reduction tools (PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP) in terms of their nearest neighbor overlap. This is the k-nearest neighbors of a given cell in the original high dimension space, in comparison to the k-nearest neighbors of a given cell in the embedding. I show that the overlap here is much lower than my audience expected. I've given this talk many times since then, for my clients.

This slide deck summarizes some work I did with Sofie Van Gassen, developer of <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/FlowSOM.html">FlowSOM</a> and all-around awesome person. We were looking at what is called the U-Matrix, a way to visualize the self organizing maps that FlowSOM produces. The question was what insights could we derive from using the U-Matrix to visualize the output of very large FlowSOM clusterings (eg. a 100 x 100 grid rather than the default 10 x 10). So far as I know, this is not explored in any major CyTOF publication, so any CyTOF users who use FlowSOM (most people at the time of writing) should have a look at this. There are visualizations in here that are useful but remain unpublished.

Invited Speaker, German CyTOF User Forum; Berlin, Germany; February 2018.
This is the talk version of my 2018 Sconify paper, that ended up being the final chapter of my PhD thesis. There are two aspects to this talk. The first is making visual comparisons of unstimulated and stimulated CyTOF data when looking at measurements of phosphoproteins. This was easily done on SPADE trees, but not t-SNE maps, until I started making k-nearest neighbor based comparisons. The second aspect of this talk is using the same nearest neighbor based comparisons to investigate batch effects in CyTOF data. I note that batch effects were only heavily discussed among CyTOF users starting near 2020 (in my circles), and this work goes back to 2016.

CYTO Conference; Prague, Czech Republic; May 2018.
Abstract: Due to the rise of high-dimensional single cell technologies in the past few years, there has been an increasing number of both computational methods and workflows to analyze the new wealth of data. However, non-intuitive properties of high-dimensional space can give rise to analysis artifacts, collectively known of as the “curse of dimensionality.” Increasing dimensions differentially affect the performance of distance metrics, and there is no clear consensus about which distance metrics to use for which analysis strategies. While the influence of many tool-specific parameters has been evaluated, we study here the impact of commonly used distance metrics on the outcome of dimensionality reduction and clustering.

This is a guest blog post I wrote for Cytobank. The formatting of the post has since been messed up (image links are broken) since Beckman acquired Cytobank and moved all the web content over. Until it gets fixed, I'm linking you to the original PDF. At the time of writing, there was still a lot of work to be done in terms of really understanding dimension reduction for CyTOF data. As such, I spent a lot of time adjusting inputs (eg. number of cells) and parameters (eg. perplexity) to understand how that affects the resulting map.

<p>
If you have one or two bad markers in your panel (noise), does it completely ruin your t-SNE/UMAP visualizations? According to my analysis so far, no. I take whole blood CyTOF data (22 dimensions) and add extra dimensions of random normal distributions, running t-SNE after each new column has been added (I've done UMAP too). What I have found:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A few dimensions of noise do not catastrophically affect the map. Lots of noise dimensions do.</li>
<li>The embedding space shrinks with increased number of dimensions. You have to hold the xy ranges constant to see this.</li>
<li>When you have many dimensions of noise, the map starts to look trajectory-like (look at the end of the gif), which could affect biological interpretation.</li>

<p>
This project asks the following question: if you run t-SNE or UMAP over and over for 100 times or more, how different does each map look from each other map? Is each map radically different? Is each map similar? Are there pockets of stability?
</p>

<p>
The spoiler alert is that the island placement of UMAP appears to be more stable than that of t-SNE, but t-SNE does display pockets of stability. This can be more easily seen by ordering the t-SNE runs by similarity.

CyTOF analysis has come a long way. Along with single-cell sequencing analysis, a lot of it is high-level functions that do what needs to be done.

Keeping it to one fcs file, we can focus on what happens when a fcs file is read into R, how it is transformed, and what the best practices of clustering, dimension reduction, and visualization are. These foundations can be built upon when looking at multiple fcs files to determine where there are differences in your control versus experiment group.

Which distance metrics are right for your data analysis. While I've created a poster on this <a href="https://tjburns08.github.io/final_distance.project.poster.pdf">here</a>, this is a stab at it from a different direction. I make synthetic CyTOF-like data, varying the dimensionality from 2 to 1000. I make a distance matrix for each distance metric used, and then correlate each one to that of the Euclidean distance matrix, which is often a default. The results are counter-intuitive.

If you want the means of your markers per cluster, be careful how you export the data.

The latter is the right way to do it. But don't take my word for it. Look at the markdown yourself.

At the time of writing (February 2025) I am frustrated by the best of the LLMs giving me results that are still in my opinion superficial. So I wrote a script that would prompt a LLM to give me an answer on something, and then with each iteration in a loop, take a piece of the answer and go deeper into it. I thought it would either converge upon something fundamental, or continually drift into different topics. I was wrong on both. The model eventually descended into emoji-laden verse, and then word salad, and then a sort of letter salad, where it started making up words, disregarding grammar, and so forth. Something like E. E.

<p>
This is a report I wrote for my uncle, who is a professor at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business. The concern was that generative language models would be able to simulate student's responses to essay questions good enough that tech-savvy students would simply offload their homework to GPT-3. I explore this option using my early access to GPT-3, with a conclusion heavily inspired by an article by <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3#weaknesses">Gwern</a>. You pretty much have to at this point.

<p>
In the age of big data, my bioinformatics analyses often lead to output that is still too much for a human to extract insight from. My use case here, common in my work: what GWAS traits do two or more genes have in common? I produce a context map of GWAS traits using an AI language model based on BERT. I then subset the map by traits associated with the genes the user inputs, coloring the points accordingly. One can quickly know what contexts, rather than traits, the genes share.

The scientific literature is overwhelming, and knowing how to utilize text mining and analytic tools can help you efficiently get what you want out of a literature search. Here, I utilize the PubMed API to find publication rates for particular topics. I show that among other things, single-cell sequencing began out-pacing mass cytometry in 2016. Insight like this helps you see how crowded a field is and especially identify trends.

Understanding how authors of a given field are connected can help you identify key individuals to pay attention to. Here is how I utilize the PubMed API to build co-author networks, which lead me to identify thought leaders in a given domain. In this article, focusing on mass cytometry, I identify two types of thought leaders: one exclusive to a particular sub-domain, and one who spans across multiple sub-domains. It is important to know both types when approaching a new topic.

A pipeline that takes as input a list of twitter user names that you supply. First, it scrapes the entire twitter history for the given names. Second, it uses BERT to make a topic-based high-dimensional embedding of every tweet per user name. If these two steps had already been done for a given user, it will update with the new tweets. Then, the user selects a subset of users to visualize. For these users, the BERT embeddings are converted into a UMAP, which is then clustered and annotated with extracted keywords per cluster. Finally, the results are visualized in an interactive user interface.

You are only as good as the questions you ask yourself and others. My uncle told me that many years ago when I was getting started with my career and it stuck. This has been relevant to me in terms of having and maintaining good friendships, being a good husband, being a good family member, being a good businessman, and when I was in graduate school, being a good scientist, and simply being an interesting person. I have a very large list of questions now that is very overwhelming. So I turned them into an embedding using the BERT language model, turned that into a nearest neighbor graph, and then derived insight from looking at the questions in terms of "communities."

I make a connection between idealizing my father during the "Dad is superman" phase of my childhood, and the Christian practice of imagining the ideal form of good (perfect kindness, perfect virtue, etc) and trying to move in that direction. The phrase "what would Jesus do" is pretty much this. The same way we have taken mindfulness out of Buddhism, I think this practice can be taken out of Christianity and also practiced in a perfectly secular way. It has benefitted me my whole life, so it's worth trying on for size.

An un-word is a word that points to that which cannot be put into words. We see examples of this in religion, where words like Tao and God are meant to point us to a vastness that is beyond anything we can possibly understand. The Christian concept of fear of God, as seen through this lens, reflects the horror and awe that comes from admitting ignorance and embracing the unknown. This is the beginning of wisdom.

This is because inherent in computer science education is the concept of computational thinking, a skill which you should have whether you use it to code, organize your thoughts, or prompt the latest AI. Even the first few months of computer science drastically helped me improve my thinking in this regard.

I spent a large portion of my life being goal-driven. I have realized more recently that being focused on the process rather than the goal is more beneficial in many respects. This essay is about my journey to that realization.

<p>
Finding truth in the real world is much different than finding truth in grad school. Grad school had me working on non-controversial, dry topics that few people in the world worked on. The real world is a lot messier. I talk about the idea of collecting opposing perspectives, steelmanning them, and putting them in dielectic to find higher truth. It's simple in theory, but hard in practice.

<p>
One of the key components to my method of solving problems is to get into the flow state. When I'm there, some or all of the problem at hand solves itself. And it feels great. I show examples of me doing this. I talk about Taoism as an ancient philosophy built around flow state, but at the macro level rather than the "within-game" level. This is the ideal of being in a perpetual flow state that lasts one's entire lifetime.

This is the idea that data visualizations that look prettier than others don't necessarily convey more truth. I use SPADE and t-SNE as examples that can produce this delusion.

<p>
I find that if I'm driving stick rather than automatic, I'm much more connected to what I'm doing, much more satisfied in the moment, and I'm objectively a better driver as a result.This concept generalizes. Pick an endeavor. Complete the analogy: automatic transmission is to your endeavor as manual transmission is to X. If you know how to do X, do it when you can. If you don't know how to do X, then learn it. I give several examples of this in my life, and I conclude by encouraging others to embody this way of doing things.

<p>
In the world of atoms, we have distinct fields of science that follow specific levels of analysis. Math leads to physics, then chemistry, biology, psychology, and sociology. But right now computer science is one single thing. But perhaps down the line, computer science will divide into distinct fields depending on levels of analysis too. From information theory, upwards to programming languages, algorithms, AI/ML, agentic AI psychology, and bot net sociology. This has implications for what it means when you tell a biology they should "learn how to code," with further implications in recruiting, problem solving, and education.

<p>
What happens under the hood when you do something simple in R, like add two numbers together? Here, I start with just that. I then show that arithmetic in R is actually parsed as S-expressions. I then go into LISP, where S-expressions are a hallmark. I then move into the source code of R, where the S-expressions for arithmetic are written, in C. And from there, I go into Assembly, the human-readable version of machine code that C is compiled into. By breaking down these layers, and going down the rabbit hole, this exercise gets us to first principles. These are foundational concepts from which we can reason and solve problems more effectively.

I am learning Lisp at the moment. In learning about the history of the language, I realized that the story of Lisp is analogous to the Tower of Babel.

<p>
When I started learning Lisp, I learned of the concept of metaprogramming. This means using code to change the programming language itself. A practical example of this in English is using "they/them" to denote gender-neutral singular pronouns, overriding the plural default. Here, I show you how to change the syntax of R to fit your fancy. I show you how to change the "+" operator in ggplot2, and to zero-index vectors, as they're done in many other programming languages. The goal of this markdown is to get you to see through and unsee the arbitrary constraints that any language, spoken/written or programming, will give you.

<p>
I lay out the rule space of elementary cellular automata as an eight dimensional dataset. I perform UMAP on rule space and color by complexity measures, the most interesting being the labeled Wolfram class of each rule. Class 3, the most chaotic behavior, shows up as little pockets in rule space. Class 4, where things like Turing completeness happen, shows up at or near these pockets, surrounded by Class 2 (repetitive, orderly). This supports the idea of Class 4 being "at the edge of chaos."

<p>
What are the fundamental units of a computer? Logic gates. I show what these are. I then show that they can be created with combinations of a single type of logic gate: NAND (Not AND). In other words, you can make a general-purpose computer if you had enough NAND gates and wires. In the spirit of this, I combine NAND gates to create a calculator that can add large numbers. One of the key points in this exercise is that it does not take much to get from NAND gates to complex computations.

My approach to health and fitness is not the goal-directed approach that seems to be prevalent everywhere these days. Rather, it's more of a flow-based approach rooted in Taoism, and taking elements from modern books like James Clear's Atomic Habits. This has worked for me for decades, and allows me to get my dopamine from the process of working out rather than the outcome. This is a highly sought after place to be, so I want to share my method in case this helps anyone else find that place too.

There is a renewed interest in Stoic philosophy as of late. It's a great set of tools that I have used for dealing with hardship. But it's 2000 years old. Where are the modern Stoics? They exist, but under a different name: psychotherapists. If psychotherapy was the successor to Stoicism, and there is so much interest in Stoicism, then shouldn't there be an equal amount of interest in clinical psychology and how it can help us? Shouldn't it be something we learn early, and make these tools part of our daily routine, as the Stoics do?

Social media is a way for me to get things off my chest that I think are valuable to the world.

Rather than spending countless hours turning it into a paper or what not, it is easier to just turn it into a social media post. Having done this for a few years now, I have a collection of social media posts. Rather than having to scroll through each of them yourself, I have organized the ones that matter by topic here.

Later work, like hypergate (Becht et al, 2019), and gatefinder (Aghaeepour et al, 2018) do the algorithmic gating strategy maker step.

<p>
This webinar is the latest iteration of my "dimensionality reduction interrogation" work, which has spanned six years. In this talk, I show the limits of these tools by looking at the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) of a given cell in the 2-D embedding space, and compare it to the K-nearest neighbors of that same cell in the high-dimensional feature space. I look at the averages across a given dataset for a given method to compare t-SNE, UMAP and PCA. I then color the maps by each cell's KNN preservation to look for patterns across the dataset. While I point out some general trends, I conclude that at least some of this depends on the dataset. Thus, I demo my free <a href="https://github.com/tjburns08/KnnSleepwalk">KnnSleepwalk</a> tool, which allows users to deterine the performance of their t-SNE's and UMAPs for their data accordingly.

But after taking an intro CS class for fun, I realized that I really enjoyed the dry-lab side of things, and my career trajectory changed accordingly. Have a listen for more details. This is part 1 of 2.

In this talk, I introduce the idea of the Scrolling Problem, which is the incompatiblity of my ADD brain and modern technology built around the infinite scroll. I talk about some work I'm doing to counteract that, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/tjburns08/twitter_archive_and_embed">here</a>. It was originally Twitter, but I switched to RSS mapping, <a href="https://github.com/tjburns08/rss_map">here</a>, after Twitter started blocking scrapers.

While I was giving my TED talk, unbeknownst to me an artist in the audience was drawing it out in real time, complete with pen and watercolor. He did this for each of the speakers. I was extremely impressed with what he was able to do given the very limited time. My talk is not yet on YouTube, but if you want the gist of it, have a look at this picture.

An article I wrote in 2020 for the annual Krupp Internship e-newsletter. It was written just after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. It serves as a time capsule for that period, in which many of our basic assumptions about the stability and the future of the modern world were upended. I enjoy looking at it again now and then, as it captures a very unique state of mind. It also captures my wedding, which took place the day before the first lockdown, and included toilet paper as a wedding present.

"Im" is short for "in dem" in German. Not a typo. An article I did for the Stanford Krupp Internship Program, which had huge impact on my life and career trajectory. In a nutshell, I was pre-med prior to my medical internship at the Charite Hospital in Berlin in 2007. Through the internship, I realized that I wanted to do research rather than clinical work. I got my PhD and came back to Berlin to work on the Charite Hospital campus once again, this time as a researcher! I will be forever grateful for the Krupp Internship program and Stanford's Bing Overseas Study Program.

Take the text you want to memorize and paste it into the box. The text will be split up into individual sentences. The first sentence will be displayed. Recite as much of the subsequent sentences as you can from memory. Buttons will allow you to move to the next sentence or the previous sentence all the way to the end of the text.

Game.<br />
</p>

<p>
A game within Conway's Game of Life. You are a blue square that you can move (with arrows), and your goal is to make contact with a "goal" square, colored green, while avoiding all the squares in the Game of Life automata that come at you. Each level up leads to a denser game board. You get five seconds of invincibility (you're colored red) in the beginning of each level, that allows you to get out of the way of any Game of Life objects near you.

A game that will always be of significance to me, because it was the assignment in my intro CS class that made me realize that I really enjoy coding. A simple implementation of breakout that runs on a single html page.

I first came across Conway's Game of Life when I was 16. It completely changed the way I think about how the world works. Or, it helped me realize the way I inherently think about the world. One of those. I consider this the first major event that moved me into the world of computer science later in life. I was above to program this up for the first time in my second intro CS class (Stanford CS106B, C++).
</p>

<p>
Rules for the grid:<br />
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If one cell is alive, and it has 2 or 3 live neighbors, it stays alive.</li>
<li>If one cell is alive, and it has fewer than 2 live neighbors, it dies as if by starvation.</li>
<li>If one cell is alive, and it has greater than 3 live neighbors, it dies as if by overpopulation.</li>
<li>If one cell is dead, then it becomes alive if it has exactly 3 live neighbors, as if by reproduction.</li>
</ol>

<p>
I added a "rule probability" box, that sets the probability that a given rule will proceed for a given cell in the grid at a given iteration. I don't see this in standard game of life implementations, but biological life has a bit of randomness involved, so why not do the same for this?
Aside from that, I have added the ability to modify the rules for the grid. This includes the ability to determine how may layers out you look for nearest neighbors. Note that when you tinker with these settings, most of the automata you get will either be too orderly or too chaotic. The Game of Life rules are a delicate balance between the two.
</p>

<p>
I have also added the ability to modify the size of the grid.

I first came across this in one of my old math books, perhaps in middle school. I just thought of it as a strange cool looking thing at the time, but what I didn't appreciate until later was how simple it was to implement. This is a single html page, under 80 lines in total. Click on any point on the screen to zoom. Note that you do lose resolution if you zoom in long enough.
