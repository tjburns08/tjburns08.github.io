<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org5fc61c0">
<p>
<a href="./meditations_chapter_one.html">I</a> am an American CEO and computational biologist who lives in Berlin, Germany. I am best known for my 12 years of work in the single-cell field, and more recently, my work in biosecurity. I am informally known for my passion for fitness, which gives me the balance and energy to do the rest of the work.
</p>

<p>
I run a company called <a href="./burns_lsc.html">Burns Life Sciences Consulting, GmbH</a>, which allows me to impact many more individuals and organizations than I otherwise could as an employee. The problem is most of my work is behind NDAs so I can't talk about it. There is another large amount of my work that is unpublished, simply because running a company has a lot of demands that don't give me the time.
</p>

<p>
This website is a place where I can openly share my ideas and non-NDA work, regardless of how "finished" it is. I have uploaded written work, code, posters and powerpoint slides of various projects I have driven or contributed to. I intend for a lot of my work here to be "long content" slowly evolving over years if not decades. What matters most is that my thoughts and the work I do that I find meaningful is uploaded here, so when I die (hopefully way down the line) others can easily build off of any worthwhile groundwork I have laid out.
</p>

<p>
If you have quesitons or comments, or you're interested in working or collaborating with me, just send me a message (see contact info below). I'm always happy to help.

<p>
I make a connection between idealizing my father during the "Dad is superman" phase of my childhood, and the Christian practice of imagining the ideal form of good (perfect kindness, perfect virtue, etc) and trying to move in that direction. The phrase "what would Jesus do" is pretty much this. The same way we have taken mindfulness out of Buddhism, I think this practice can be taken out of Christianity and also practiced in a perfectly secular way. It has benefitted me my whole life, so it's worth trying on for size.

</p>

<p>
In a standard single cell RNA sequencing analysis pipeline, one of the first things you do is find and use only the most variable genes, as measured by gene expression and dispersion. These variable genes are sufficient to be used in downstream analysis, like clustering and dimensionality reduction. Here, I test whether I can do the same thing for the Universal Cell Embeddings (UCE) foundation model, which in theory could save time and compute. I find that running only the variable genes through UCE leads to poorer cell type separation, as measured by both UMAP and PCA. This suggests that those who use UCE should use the full datasets, not filtered ones.

I find that if I'm driving stick rather than automatic, I'm much more connected to what I'm doing, much more satisfied in the moment, and I'm objectively a better driver as a result.This concept generalizes. Pick an endeavor. Complete the analogy: automatic transmission is to your endeavor as manual transmission is to X. If you know how to do X, do it when you can. If you don't know how to do X, then learn it. I give several examples of this in my life, and I conclude by encouraging others to embody this way of doing things.

Markdown.<br />
</p>

<p>
In this markdown, we import two PBMC datasets, the PBMC 3k and the PBMC 10k datasets. The 3k dataset is a flagship dataset used in the early days of Seurat. The 10k dataset is the default that is run through the model if you don't specify another dataset. Here, I show that if we look at a UMAP embedding, the datasets do not sit on top of each other. However, if we use my KnnSleepwalk package, we find that the distances on the UMAP are distorted. What we find is that, for example, the T cell island for the 3k datset sits much closer to the T cell island for the 10k dataset. This in turn suggests that we should be careful using UMAP to assess foundation models in single-cell and in any field.

<p>
This is a jupyter notebook that looks at the Universal Cell Embeddings transformer foundation model for single-cell sequencing. It is part of an emerging sub-field of foundation model building within single-cell sequencing. The output of the model is a 1280 dimensional embedding. Here, to get a sense of the geometry of the embedding, I look at the center and the outer edges. I visualize this in the context of UMAP space, and find that UMAP does not properly capture center-ness. I further find that center-ness is positively associated with both frequency of cell subset and per-subset density. I conclude that center-ness is a worthwhile feature to look at in the context of these models, and that it is not something that UMAP can be relied upon to capture.

This is an expression I use a lot in casual conversation.

This essay tells the story of how doing this from my teenage years onwards, has contributed to a lot of my good decisions thus far.

Webinar.<br />
</p>

<p>
This webinar is the latest iteration of my "dimensionality reduction interrogation" work, which has spanned six years. In this talk, I show the limits of these tools by looking at the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) of a given cell in the 2-D embedding space, and compare it to the K-nearest neighbors of that same cell in the high-dimensional feature space. I look at the averages across a given dataset for a given method to compare t-SNE, UMAP and PCA. I then color the maps by each cell's KNN preservation to look for patterns across the dataset. While I point out some general trends, I conclude that at least some of this depends on the dataset. Thus, I demo my free <a href="https://github.com/tjburns08/KnnSleepwalk">KnnSleepwalk</a> tool, which allows users to deterine the performance of their t-SNE's and UMAPs for their data accordingly.

Seurat is an R package that runs single-cell sequencing and related data. Here, I trick Seurat into thinking my CyTOF PBMC data is single-cell sequencing data. I find out that the effective dimensionality of my CyTOF data appears to be much less than the surface markers I am using (15). This is a counter-intuitive result because our features are carefully curated before the experiment is done.

<p>
In flow cytometry and CyTOF analysis, we distinguish between "type" and "state" markers, so we can cluster on the former and analyze per-cluster expression changes in the latter. For single-cell RNA sequencing, we cannot make this distinguishment. Thus, we have to rely on data integration algorithms when we are analyzing pre-treatment and post-treatment datasets. I show how this is done, and I show how failure to do so can lead research teams to falsely interpret the data, and make false conclusions. Thus, understanding data integration is critical to keeping research teams on track.

I started out analyzing CyTOF data, as I did my PhD in the lab of Garry Nolan from 2012-2017, where CyTOF was initially being developed and applied to immunology and cancer bilogy. I later broadened to single-cell sequencing and high-parameter imaging (both proteins and genes). The work below consists primarily of markdowns, with code and explanations that allow users to do things that have helped me a lot in my work, but I don't necessarily have the time to turn into publications.

X-shift is a popular clustering algorithm for CyTOF and related high-dimensional data that is related to mean-shift clustering. It is especially good for the detection of rare cell subsets. While X-shift is computationally intensive and written in java to overcome several engineering hurdles accordingly, here I show you a simplified version of X-shift written in R that leverages the igraph package. The purpose of this markdown is to show you how X-shift works in a language that is less verbose and more familiar to the average CyTOF user than java.

Phenograph is a popular CyTOF clustering algorithm, which is really Louvain community detection of a K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) graph. Of note, this is the primary clustering tool used in Seurat for scRNA seq data. Here, I make the KNN graph myself for CyTOF data, and contrast it with the mutual nearest neighbor (MNN) graph, where Cell 1 is connected to Cell 2 if and only if they both are part of each other's respective KNN. I find that clustering the MNN graph might provide a little more resolution than the KNN graph, if properly optimized.

I typically analyze CyTOF data in R. However, there are plenty of reasons why one might want to analyze CyTOF data in other languages as well. Here, I show that you can use python, julia, C++, SQL, and Rust directly in R Markdown. I do most of my work in R Markdown these days, but I like the flexibility of being able to switch from one language to the other and back, all in the same literate programming environement.

Seurat is an R package that runs single-cell sequencing and related data. Here, I trick Seurat into thinking my CyTOF PBMC data is single-cell sequencing data. I find out that the effective dimensionality of my CyTOF data appears to be much less than the surface markers I am using (15). This is a counter-intuitive result because our features are carefully curated before the experiment is done.

You can parse a fcs file from scratch without flowCore. I read in a fcs file line by line, rather than using the standard read.FCS from flowCore. We can't read the data directly this way, but we can read in the header and the text. For the data, we read in the bytes, convert them into decimal, and then build the expression matrix.

Abstract: In high-dimensional single cell data, comparing changes in functional markers between conditions is typically done across manual or algorithm-derived partitions based on population-defining markers. Visualizations of these partitions is commonly done on low-dimensional embeddings (eg. t-SNE), colored by per-partition changes. Here, we provide an analysis and visualization tool that performs these comparisons across overlapping k-nearest neighbor (KNN) groupings. This allows one to color low-dimensional embeddings by marker changes without hard boundaries imposed by partitioning. We devised an objective optimization of k based on minimizing functional marker KNN imputation error. Proof-of-concept work visualized the exact location of an IL-7 responsive subset in a B cell developmental trajectory on a t-SNE map independent of clustering. Per-condition cell frequency analysis revealed that KNN is sensitive to detecting artifacts due to marker shift, and therefore can also be valuable in a quality control pipeline. Overall, we found that KNN groupings lead to useful multiple condition visualizations and efficiently extract a large amount of information from mass cytometry data. Our software is publicly available through the Bioconductor package Sconify.

Abstract: To quantify visual and spatial information in single cells with a throughput of thousands of cells per second, we developed Subcellular Localization Assay (SLA). This adaptation of Proximity Ligation Assay expands the capabilities of flow cytometry to include data relating to localization of proteins to and within organelles. We used SLA to detect the nuclear import of transcription factors across cell subsets in complex samples. We further measured intranuclear re-localization of target proteins across the cell cycle and upon DNA damage induction. SLA combines multiple single-cell methods to bring about a new dimension of inquiry and analysis in complex cell populations. © 2017 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.

<p>
In sum: I started by developing a method to enable flow and mass cytometry to detect and quantify nuclear localization, called Subcellular Localization Assay (SLA), which came out of a collaboration with the lab of Ola Soederberg at University of Uppsala, Sweden.

In parallel, I was taking computer science classes as a side hobby. I reached a point where I was trying to compare two t-SNE maps between unstimulated and simulated data, and I realized that there was a K-Nearest Neighbors based solution that I could implement with my newfoud computer science competencies. I therefore developed Sconify, a now BioConductor package that allows for these visualizations. There were many use cases, and I spent the remainder of my thesis developing this method further and doing various collaborations with it.

German CyTOF User Forum; Berlin, Germany; January 2020.
In this talk, I measured the accurracy of dimension reduction tools (PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP) in terms of their nearest neighbor overlap. This is the k-nearest neighbors of a given cell in the original high dimension space, in comparison to the k-nearest neighbors of a given cell in the embedding. I show that the overlap here is much lower than my audience expected. I've given this talk many times since then, for my clients.

This slide deck summarizes some work I did with Sofie Van Gassen, developer of <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/FlowSOM.html">FlowSOM</a> and all-around awesome person. We were looking at what is called the U-Matrix, a way to visualize the self organizing maps that FlowSOM produces. The question was what insights could we derive from using the U-Matrix to visualize the output of very large FlowSOM clusterings (eg. a 100 x 100 grid rather than the default 10 x 10). So far as I know, this is not explored in any major CyTOF publication, so any CyTOF users who use FlowSOM (most people at the time of writing) should have a look at this. There are visualizations in here that are useful but remain unpublished.

Invited Speaker, German CyTOF User Forum; Berlin, Germany; February 2018.
This is the talk version of my 2018 Sconify paper, that ended up being the final chapter of my PhD thesis. There are two aspects to this talk. The first is making visual comparisons of unstimulated and stimulated CyTOF data when looking at measurements of phosphoproteins. This was easily done on SPADE trees, but not t-SNE maps, until I started making k-nearest neighbor based comparisons. The second aspect of this talk is using the same nearest neighbor based comparisons to investigate batch effects in CyTOF data. I note that batch effects were only heavily discussed among CyTOF users starting near 2020 (in my circles), and this work goes back to 2016.

CYTO Conference; Prague, Czech Republic; May 2018.
Abstract: Due to the rise of high-dimensional single cell technologies in the past few years, there has been an increasing number of both computational methods and workflows to analyze the new wealth of data. However, non-intuitive properties of high-dimensional space can give rise to analysis artifacts, collectively known of as the “curse of dimensionality.” Increasing dimensions differentially affect the performance of distance metrics, and there is no clear consensus about which distance metrics to use for which analysis strategies. While the influence of many tool-specific parameters has been evaluated, we study here the impact of commonly used distance metrics on the outcome of dimensionality reduction and clustering.

This is a guest blog post I wrote for Cytobank. The formatting of the post has since been messed up (image links are broken) since Beckman acquired Cytobank and moved all the web content over. Until it gets fixed, I'm linking you to the original PDF. At the time of writing, there was still a lot of work to be done in terms of really understanding dimension reduction for CyTOF data. As such, I spent a lot of time adjusting inputs (eg. number of cells) and parameters (eg. perplexity) to understand how that affects the resulting map.

If you have one or two bad markers in your panel (noise), does it completely ruin your t-SNE/UMAP visualizations? According to my analysis so far, no. I take whole blood CyTOF data (22 dimensions) and add extra dimensions of random normal distributions, running t-SNE after each new column has been added (I've done UMAP too). What I have found:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A few dimensions of noise do not catastrophically affect the map. Lots of noise dimensions do.</li>
<li>The embedding space shrinks with increased number of dimensions. You have to hold the xy ranges constant to see this.</li>
<li>When you have many dimensions of noise, the map starts to look trajectory-like (look at the end of the gif), which could affect biological interpretation.</li>

This project asks the following question: if you run t-SNE or UMAP over and over for 100 times or more, how different does each map look from each other map? Is each map radically different? Is each map similar? Are there pockets of stability?
</p>

<p>
The spoiler alert is that the island placement of UMAP appears to be more stable than that of t-SNE, but t-SNE does display pockets of stability. This can be more easily seen by ordering the t-SNE runs by similarity.

CyTOF analysis has come a long way. Along with single-cell sequencing analysis, a lot of it is high-level functions that do what needs to be done.

Which distance metrics are right for your data analysis. While I've created a poster on this <a href="https://tjburns08.github.io/final_distance.project.poster.pdf">here</a>, this is a stab at it from a different direction. I make synthetic CyTOF-like data, varying the dimensionality from 2 to 1000. I make a distance matrix for each distance metric used, and then correlate each one to that of the Euclidean distance matrix, which is often a default. The results are counter-intuitive.

If you want the means of your markers per cluster, be careful how you export the data. If you export the means of the raw values per cluster, and take the asinh(x/5) transform of that, the values will be different than if you take the means of the asinh(x/5) transformed data per cluster.

CyTOF data are transformed using the inverse hyperbolic sine (asinh) of the data divided by 5 (aka scale argument of 5). But does it have to be like that? What happens if we use a scale argument of 1? 500? What if we do a log transform? How does t-SNE look on untransformed CyTOF data?

<p>
In this study, we take news articles that correspond to CNN, FoxNews, and AP, from their Twitter handles, and their BERT embeddings, and produce a map of news space. We figure out what areas of news space are heavy in one news source or the other (perhaps corresponding to political bias). We find that Fox News in general reports heavily on the topic of politics in comparison to CNN and AP, and that while AP is supposed to be neutral, there are still regions of news space that are heavy in AP content. Interactive maps are included for the user to explore.

This is a report I wrote for my uncle, who is a professor at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business. The concern was that generative language models would be able to simulate student's responses to essay questions good enough that tech-savvy students would simply offload their homework to GPT-3. I explore this option using my early access to GPT-3, with a conclusion heavily inspired by an article by <a href="https://www.gwern.net/GPT-3#weaknesses">Gwern</a>.

<p>
In the age of big data, my bioinformatics analyses often lead to output that is still too much for a human to extract insight from. My use case here, common in my work: what GWAS traits do two or more genes have in common? I produce a context map of GWAS traits using an AI language model based on BERT. I then subset the map by traits associated with the genes the user inputs, coloring the points accordingly. One can quickly know what contexts, rather than traits, the genes share.

The scientific literature is overwhelming, and knowing how to utilize text mining and analytic tools can help you efficiently get what you want out of a literature search. Here, I utilize the PubMed API to find publication rates for particular topics. I show that among other things, single-cell sequencing began out-pacing mass cytometry in 2016. Insight like this helps you see how crowded a field is and especially identify trends.

Understanding how authors of a given field are connected can help you identify key individuals to pay attention to. Here is how I utilize the PubMed API to build co-author networks, which lead me to identify thought leaders in a given domain. In this article, focusing on mass cytometry, I identify two types of thought leaders: one exclusive to a particular sub-domain, and one who spans across multiple sub-domains. It is important to know both types when approaching a new topic.

A pipeline that takes as input a list of twitter user names that you supply. First, it scrapes the entire twitter history for the given names. Second, it uses BERT to make a topic-based high-dimensional embedding of every tweet per user name. If these two steps had already been done for a given user, it will update with the new tweets. Then, the user selects a subset of users to visualize. For these users, the BERT embeddings are converted into a UMAP, which is then clustered and annotated with extracted keywords per cluster. Finally, the results are visualized in an interactive user interface.

You are only as good as the questions you ask yourself and others. My uncle told me that many years ago when I was getting started with my career and it stuck. This has been relevant to me in terms of having and maintaining good friendships, being a good husband, being a good family member, being a good businessman, and when I was in graduate school, being a good scientist, and simply being an interesting person. I have a very large list of questions now that is very overwhelming. So I turned them into an embedding using the BERT language model, turned that into a nearest neighbor graph, and then derived insight from looking at the questions in terms of "communities."

I make a connection between idealizing my father during the "Dad is superman" phase of my childhood, and the Christian practice of imagining the ideal form of good (perfect kindness, perfect virtue, etc) and trying to move in that direction. The phrase "what would Jesus do" is pretty much this. The same way we have taken mindfulness out of Buddhism, I think this practice can be taken out of Christianity and also practiced in a perfectly secular way. It has benefitted me my whole life, so it's worth trying on for size.

An un-word is a word that points to that which cannot be put into words.

This is because inherent in computer science education is the concept of computational thinking, a skill which you should have whether you use it to code, organize your thoughts, or prompt the latest AI. Even the first few months of computer science drastically helped me improve my thinking in this regard. This essay goes into the concepts around computational thinking, and tells you how you can learn it too, in a shorter time than you think.

<p>
Finding truth in the real world is much different than finding truth in grad school. Grad school had me working on non-controversial, dry topics that few people in the world worked on. The real world is a lot messier. I talk about the idea of collecting opposing perspectives, steelmanning them, and putting them in dielectic to find higher truth. It's simple in theory, but hard in practice.

<p>
One of the key components to my method of solving problems is to get into the flow state. When I'm there, some or all of the problem at hand solves itself. And it feels great. I show examples of me doing this. I talk about Taoism as an ancient philosophy built around flow state, but at the macro level rather than the "within-game" level. This is the ideal of being in a perpetual flow state that lasts one's entire lifetime.

I find that if I'm driving stick rather than automatic, I'm much more connected to what I'm doing, much more satisfied in the moment, and I'm objectively a better driver as a result.This concept generalizes. Pick an endeavor. Complete the analogy: automatic transmission is to your endeavor as manual transmission is to X. If you know how to do X, do it when you can. If you don't know how to do X, then learn it. I give several examples of this in my life, and I conclude by encouraging others to embody this way of doing things.

<p>
When I started learning Lisp, I learned of the concept of metaprogramming. This means using code to change the programming language itself. A practical example of this in English is using "they/them" to denote gender-neutral singular pronouns, overriding the plural default. Here, I show you how to change the syntax of R to fit your fancy. I show you how to change the "+" operator in ggplot2, and to zero-index vectors, as they're done in many other programming languages. The goal of this markdown is to get you to see through and unsee the arbitrary constraints that any language, spoken/written or programming, will give you.

<p>
I lay out the rule space of elementary cellular automata as an eight dimensional dataset. I perform UMAP on rule space and color by complexity measures, the most interesting being the labeled Wolfram class of each rule. Class 3, the most chaotic behavior, shows up as little pockets in rule space. Class 4, where things like Turing completeness happen, shows up at or near these pockets, surrounded by Class 2 (repetitive, orderly). This supports the idea of Class 4 being "at the edge of chaos."

What are the fundamental units of a computer? Logic gates. I show what these are. I then show that they can be created with combinations of a single type of logic gate: NAND (Not AND). In other words, you can make a general-purpose computer if you had enough NAND gates and wires. In the spirit of this, I combine NAND gates to create a calculator that can add large numbers. One of the key points in this exercise is that it does not take much to get from NAND gates to complex computations.

My approach to health and fitness is not the goal-directed approach that seems to be prevalent everywhere these days.

This has worked for me for decades, and allows me to get my dopamine from the process of working out rather than the outcome. This is a highly sought after place to be, so I want to share my method in case this helps anyone else find that place too.

If psychotherapy was the successor to Stoicism, and there is so much interest in Stoicism, then shouldn't there be an equal amount of interest in clinical psychology and how it can help us? Shouldn't it be something we learn early, and make these tools part of our daily routine, as the Stoics do?

Social media is a way for me to get things off my chest that I think are valuable to the world.

Rather than spending countless hours turning it into a paper or what not, it is easier to just turn it into a social media post. Having done this for a few years now, I have a collection of social media posts. Rather than having to scroll through each of them yourself, I have organized the ones that matter by topic here.

<p>
This webinar is the latest iteration of my "dimensionality reduction interrogation" work, which has spanned six years. In this talk, I show the limits of these tools by looking at the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) of a given cell in the 2-D embedding space, and compare it to the K-nearest neighbors of that same cell in the high-dimensional feature space. I look at the averages across a given dataset for a given method to compare t-SNE, UMAP and PCA. I then color the maps by each cell's KNN preservation to look for patterns across the dataset. While I point out some general trends, I conclude that at least some of this depends on the dataset. Thus, I demo my free <a href="https://github.com/tjburns08/KnnSleepwalk">KnnSleepwalk</a> tool, which allows users to deterine the performance of their t-SNE's and UMAPs for their data accordingly.

While I was giving my TED talk, unbeknownst to me an artist in the audience was drawing it out in real time, complete with pen and watercolor. He did this for each of the speakers. I was extremely impressed with what he was able to do given the very limited time. My talk is not yet on YouTube, but if you want the gist of it, have a look at this picture.

An article I wrote in 2020 for the annual Krupp Internship e-newsletter. It was written just after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. It serves as a time capsule for that period, in which many of our basic assumptions about the stability and the future of the modern world were upended. I enjoy looking at it again now and then, as it captures a very unique state of mind. It also captures my wedding, which took place the day before the first lockdown, and included toilet paper as a wedding present.

"Im" is short for "in dem" in German. Not a typo. An article I did for the Stanford Krupp Internship Program, which had huge impact on my life and career trajectory. In a nutshell, I was pre-med prior to my medical internship at the Charite Hospital in Berlin in 2007. Through the internship, I realized that I wanted to do research rather than clinical work. I got my PhD and came back to Berlin to work on the Charite Hospital campus once again, this time as a researcher! I will be forever grateful for the Krupp Internship program and Stanford's Bing Overseas Study Program.

Take the text you want to memorize and paste it into the box. The text will be split up into individual sentences. The first sentence will be displayed. Recite as much of the subsequent sentences as you can from memory. Buttons will allow you to move to the next sentence or the previous sentence all the way to the end of the text.

Game.<br />
</p>

<p>
A game within Conway's Game of Life. You are a blue square that you can move (with arrows), and your goal is to make contact with a "goal" square, colored green, while avoiding all the squares in the Game of Life automata that come at you. Each level up leads to a denser game board. You get five seconds of invincibility (you're colored red) in the beginning of each level, that allows you to get out of the way of any Game of Life objects near you.

A game that will always be of significance to me, because it was the assignment in my intro CS class that made me realize that I really enjoy coding. A simple implementation of breakout that runs on a single html page.

I first came across Conway's Game of Life when I was 16. It completely changed the way I think about how the world works. Or, it helped me realize the way I inherently think about the world. One of those. I consider this the first major event that moved me into the world of computer science later in life. I was above to program this up for the first time in my second intro CS class (Stanford CS106B, C++).
</p>

<p>
Rules for the grid:<br />
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If one cell is alive, and it has 2 or 3 live neighbors, it stays alive.</li>
<li>If one cell is alive, and it has fewer than 2 live neighbors, it dies as if by starvation.</li>
<li>If one cell is alive, and it has greater than 3 live neighbors, it dies as if by overpopulation.</li>
<li>If one cell is dead, then it becomes alive if it has exactly 3 live neighbors, as if by reproduction.</li>
</ol>

<p>
I added a "rule probability" box, that sets the probability that a given rule will proceed for a given cell in the grid at a given iteration. I don't see this in standard game of life implementations, but biological life has a bit of randomness involved, so why not do the same for this?
Aside from that, I have added the ability to modify the rules for the grid. This includes the ability to determine how may layers out you look for nearest neighbors. Note that when you tinker with these settings, most of the automata you get will either be too orderly or too chaotic. The Game of Life rules are a delicate balance between the two.
</p>

<p>
I have also added the ability to modify the size of the grid.

I first came across this in one of my old math books, perhaps in middle school. I just thought of it as a strange cool looking thing at the time, but what I didn't appreciate until later was how simple it was to implement. This is a single html page, under 80 lines in total. Click on any point on the screen to zoom. Note that you do lose resolution if you zoom in long enough.
