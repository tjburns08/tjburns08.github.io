<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgff9ada7">
<p>
<a href="./meditations_chapter_one.html">I</a> am an American CEO and computational biologist who lives in Berlin, Germany. I am best known for my 12 years of work in the single-cell field, and more recently, my work in biosecurity. I am informally known for my passion for fitness, which gives me the balance and energy to do the rest of the work.
</p>

<p>
I run a company called <a href="./burns_lsc.html">Burns Life Sciences Consulting, GmbH</a>, which allows me to impact many more individuals and organizations than I otherwise could as an employee. The problem is most of my work is behind NDAs so I can't talk about it. There is another large amount of my work that is unpublished, simply because running a company has a lot of demands that don't give me the time.
</p>

<p>
This website is a place where I can openly share my ideas and non-NDA work, regardless of how "finished" it is. I have uploaded written work, code, posters and powerpoint slides of various projects I have driven or contributed to. I intend for a lot of my work here to be "long content" slowly evolving over years if not decades. What matters most is that my thoughts and the work I do that I find meaningful is uploaded here, so when I die (hopefully way down the line) others can easily build off of any worthwhile groundwork I have laid out.

If you have quesitons or comments, or you're interested in working or collaborating with me, just send me a message (see contact info below). I'm always happy to help.

What happens when you omit PCA from a Seurat scRNA-seq pipeline? Here, Using the flagship pre-annotated PBMC 3k dataset, I tested this by inputting the top 2000 variable genes directly into UMAP, bypassing PCA. The results showed less spatially resolved subsets, particularly among CD4 T cells. Furthermore, I found that in the no-PCA condition, performance (measured by how well cell subsets could be resolved) was substantially worse when using Euclidean distance rather than cosine distance. These differences went away when the top 10 PCs were used as input (which again is standard best practices). These results suggest that in this context, the choice of distance metric matters more in higher dimensions. Thus, I recommend defaulting to cosine distance or testing both metrics side by side when using UMAP or similar tools on high-dimensional datasets.

<p>
Universal Cell Embeddings (UCE) is a foundation model that takes a single-cell dataset as input and outputs a 1280 dimensional embedding that is relevant in the context of a large number of single-cell datasets that it was trained on. This model can in turn do things like label transfer between datasets. Here, I looked at the embedding within the PBMC 3k dataset and simply asked how many k-nearest neighbors per cell are shared between the original dataset and its UCE embedding. Specifically, I used the first 50 PCs of the PBMC 3k dataset's top 2000 most variable genes (standard practice), and the first 50 PCs of the UCE model. The results suggest that nearest neighbors are preserved at the labeled cell subset level but the resolution does not go beyond this. Note: I also compared the first 50 PCs of the PBMC 3k dataset with the entire 1280 dimensions of the UCE output, and the results were slightly worse but similar.

This markdown is for people with PBMC datasets, who want a convenient way to annoate them using the markers specified in Seurat's <a href="https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html">guided clustering tutorial</a>. Here, we take the aforementioned tutorial and run the PBMC 3k dataset through it. Then, we have a block of code that loops through each of the populations identified in the tutorial and looks for the relevant markers in the clustering scheme from our run. This allows the user to quickly and conveniently figure out what cluster belongs to what population.

Seurat's FeaturePlot has a built in color scheme that goes from grey (zero expression) through violet, to a deep blue for the highest expression. People like me who started with CyTOF in Cytobank or similar tools are used to a color scheme that starts with blue, then goes through cyan, green, yellow, orange, then red. Here, I re-make that color palette for use in Seurat's FeaturePlot. Then, I further show how to make the FeaturePlot output with the altered color palette independent of Seurat.

<p>
What happens under the hood when you do something simple in R, like add two numbers together? Here, I start with just that. I then show that arithmetic in R is actually parsed as S-expressions. I then go into LISP, where S-expressions are a hallmark. I then move into the source code of R, where the S-expressions for arithmetic are written, in C. And from there, I go into Assembly, the human-readable version of machine code that C is compiled into. By breaking down these layers, and going down the rabbit hole, this exercise gets us to first principles. These are foundational concepts from which we can reason and solve problems more effectively.

I make a connection between idealizing my father during the "Dad is superman" phase of my childhood, and the Christian practice of imagining the ideal form of good (perfect kindness, perfect virtue, etc) and trying to move in that direction. The phrase "what would Jesus do" is pretty much this. The same way we have taken mindfulness out of Buddhism, I think this practice can be taken out of Christianity and also practiced in a perfectly secular way. It has benefitted me my whole life, so it's worth trying on for size.

Markdown.<br />
</p>

<p>
In a standard single cell RNA sequencing analysis pipeline, one of the first things you do is find and use only the most variable genes, as measured by gene expression and dispersion. These variable genes are sufficient to be used in downstream analysis, like clustering and dimensionality reduction. Here, I test whether I can do the same thing for the Universal Cell Embeddings (UCE) foundation model, which in theory could save time and compute. I find that running only the variable genes through UCE leads to poorer cell type separation, as measured by both UMAP and PCA. This suggests that those who use UCE should use the full datasets, not filtered ones.

I find that if I'm driving stick rather than automatic, I'm much more connected to what I'm doing, much more satisfied in the moment, and I'm objectively a better driver as a result.This concept generalizes. Pick an endeavor. Complete the analogy: automatic transmission is to your endeavor as manual transmission is to X. If you know how to do X, do it when you can. If you don't know how to do X, then learn it. I give several examples of this in my life, and I conclude by encouraging others to embody this way of doing things.

Markdown.<br />
</p>

<p>
In this markdown, we import two PBMC datasets, the PBMC 3k and the PBMC 10k datasets. The 3k dataset is a flagship dataset used in the early days of Seurat. The 10k dataset is the default that is run through the model if you don't specify another dataset. Here, I show that if we look at a UMAP embedding, the datasets do not sit on top of each other. However, if we use my KnnSleepwalk package, we find that the distances on the UMAP are distorted. What we find is that, for example, the T cell island for the 3k datset sits much closer to the T cell island for the 10k dataset. This in turn suggests that we should be careful using UMAP to assess foundation models in single-cell and in any field.

<p>
This is a jupyter notebook that looks at the Universal Cell Embeddings transformer foundation model for single-cell sequencing. It is part of an emerging sub-field of foundation model building within single-cell sequencing. The output of the model is a 1280 dimensional embedding. Here, to get a sense of the geometry of the embedding, I look at the center and the outer edges. I visualize this in the context of UMAP space, and find that UMAP does not properly capture center-ness. I further find that center-ness is positively associated with both frequency of cell subset and per-subset density. I conclude that center-ness is a worthwhile feature to look at in the context of these models, and that it is not something that UMAP can be relied upon to capture.

<p>
This webinar is the latest iteration of my "dimensionality reduction interrogation" work, which has spanned six years. In this talk, I show the limits of these tools by looking at the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) of a given cell in the 2-D embedding space, and compare it to the K-nearest neighbors of that same cell in the high-dimensional feature space. I look at the averages across a given dataset for a given method to compare t-SNE, UMAP and PCA. I then color the maps by each cell's KNN preservation to look for patterns across the dataset. While I point out some general trends, I conclude that at least some of this depends on the dataset. Thus, I demo my free <a href="https://github.com/tjburns08/KnnSleepwalk">KnnSleepwalk</a> tool, which allows users to deterine the performance of their t-SNE's and UMAPs for their data accordingly.

<p>
In flow cytometry and CyTOF analysis, we distinguish between "type" and "state" markers, so we can cluster on the former and analyze per-cluster expression changes in the latter. For single-cell RNA sequencing, we cannot make this distinguishment. Thus, we have to rely on data integration algorithms when we are analyzing pre-treatment and post-treatment datasets. I show how this is done, and I show how failure to do so can lead research teams to falsely interpret the data, and make false conclusions. Thus, understanding data integration is critical to keeping research teams on track.

Universal Cell Embeddings (UCE) is a foundation model that takes a single-cell dataset as input and outputs a 1280 dimensional embedding that is relevant in the context of a large number of single-cell datasets that it was trained on. This model can in turn do things like label transfer between datasets. Here, I looked at the embedding within the PBMC 3k dataset and simply asked how many k-nearest neighbors per cell are shared between the original dataset and its UCE embedding. Specifically, I used the first 50 PCs of the PBMC 3k dataset's top 2000 most variable genes (standard practice), and the first 50 PCs of the UCE model. The results suggest that nearest neighbors are preserved at the labeled cell subset level but the resolution does not go beyond this. Note: I also compared the first 50 PCs of the PBMC 3k dataset with the entire 1280 dimensions of the UCE output, and the results were slightly worse but similar.

This markdown is for people with PBMC datasets, who want a convenient way to annoate them using the markers specified in Seurat's <a href="https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html">guided clustering tutorial</a>. Here, we take the aforementioned tutorial and run the PBMC 3k dataset through it. Then, we have a block of code that loops through each of the populations identified in the tutorial and looks for the relevant markers in the clustering scheme from our run. This allows the user to quickly and conveniently figure out what cluster belongs to what population.

Seurat's FeaturePlot has a built in color scheme that goes from grey (zero expression) through violet, to a deep blue for the highest expression. People like me who started with CyTOF in Cytobank or similar tools are used to a color scheme that starts with blue, then goes through cyan, green, yellow, orange, then red. Here, I re-make that color palette for use in Seurat's FeaturePlot. Then, I further show how to make the FeaturePlot output with the altered color palette independent of Seurat.

<p>
In a standard single cell RNA sequencing analysis pipeline, one of the first things you do is find and use only the most variable genes, as measured by gene expression and dispersion. These variable genes are sufficient to be used in downstream analysis, like clustering and dimensionality reduction. Here, I test whether I can do the same thing for the Universal Cell Embeddings (UCE) foundation model, which in theory could save time and compute. I find that running only the variable genes through UCE leads to poorer cell type separation, as measured by both UMAP and PCA. This suggests that those who use UCE should use the full datasets, not filtered ones.

<p>
In this markdown, we import two PBMC datasets, the PBMC 3k and the PBMC 10k datasets. The 3k dataset is a flagship dataset used in the early days of Seurat. The 10k dataset is the default that is run through the model if you don't specify another dataset. Here, I show that if we look at a UMAP embedding, the datasets do not sit on each other. However, if we use my KnnSleepwalk package, we find that the distances on the UMAP are distorted. What we find is that, for example, the T cell island for the 3k datset sits much closer to the T cell island for the 10k dataset. This in turn suggests that we should be careful using UMAP to assess foundation models in single-cell and in any field.

This is a jupyter notebook that looks at the Universal Cell Embeddings transformer foundation model for single-cell sequencing. It is part of an emerging sub-field of foundation model building within single-cell sequencing. The output of the model is a 1280 dimensional embedding. Here, to get a sense of the geometry of the embedding, I look at the center and the outer edges. I visualize this in the context of UMAP space, and find that UMAP does not properly capture center-ness. I further find that center-ness is positively associated with both frequency of cell subset and per-subset density. I conclude that center-ness is a worthwhile feature to look at in the context of these models, and that it is not something that UMAP can be relied upon to capture.

X-shift is a popular clustering algorithm for CyTOF and related high-dimensional data that is related to mean-shift clustering. It is especially good for the detection of rare cell subsets.

<p>
In flow cytometry and CyTOF analysis, we distinguish between "type" and "state" markers, so we can cluster on the former and analyze per-cluster expression changes in the latter. For single-cell RNA sequencing, we cannot make this distinguishment. Thus, we have to rely on data integration algorithms when we are analyzing pre-treatment and post-treatment datasets. I show how this is done, and I show how failure to do so can lead research teams to falsely interpret the data, and make false conclusions. Thus, understanding data integration is critical to keeping research teams on track.

Phenograph is a popular CyTOF clustering algorithm, which is really Louvain community detection of a K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) graph. Of note, this is the primary clustering tool used in Seurat for scRNA seq data. Here, I make the KNN graph myself for CyTOF data, and contrast it with the mutual nearest neighbor (MNN) graph, where Cell 1 is connected to Cell 2 if and only if they both are part of each other's respective KNN. I find that clustering the MNN graph might provide a little more resolution than the KNN graph, if properly optimized.

Seurat is an R package that runs single-cell sequencing and related data. Here, I trick Seurat into thinking my CyTOF PBMC data is single-cell sequencing data. I find out that the effective dimensionality of my CyTOF data appears to be much less than the surface markers I am using (15). This is a counter-intuitive result because our features are carefully curated before the experiment is done.

Abstract: In high-dimensional single cell data, comparing changes in functional markers between conditions is typically done across manual or algorithm-derived partitions based on population-defining markers. Visualizations of these partitions is commonly done on low-dimensional embeddings (eg. t-SNE), colored by per-partition changes. Here, we provide an analysis and visualization tool that performs these comparisons across overlapping k-nearest neighbor (KNN) groupings. This allows one to color low-dimensional embeddings by marker changes without hard boundaries imposed by partitioning. We devised an objective optimization of k based on minimizing functional marker KNN imputation error. Proof-of-concept work visualized the exact location of an IL-7 responsive subset in a B cell developmental trajectory on a t-SNE map independent of clustering. Per-condition cell frequency analysis revealed that KNN is sensitive to detecting artifacts due to marker shift, and therefore can also be valuable in a quality control pipeline. Overall, we found that KNN groupings lead to useful multiple condition visualizations and efficiently extract a large amount of information from mass cytometry data. Our software is publicly available through the Bioconductor package Sconify.

Abstract: To quantify visual and spatial information in single cells with a throughput of thousands of cells per second, we developed Subcellular Localization Assay (SLA). This adaptation of Proximity Ligation Assay expands the capabilities of flow cytometry to include data relating to localization of proteins to and within organelles. We used SLA to detect the nuclear import of transcription factors across cell subsets in complex samples. We further measured intranuclear re-localization of target proteins across the cell cycle and upon DNA damage induction. SLA combines multiple single-cell methods to bring about a new dimension of inquiry and analysis in complex cell populations. © 2017 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.

In sum: I started by developing a method to enable flow and mass cytometry to detect and quantify nuclear localization, called Subcellular Localization Assay (SLA), which came out of a collaboration with the lab of Ola Soederberg at University of Uppsala, Sweden.

In parallel, I was taking computer science classes as a side hobby. I reached a point where I was trying to compare two t-SNE maps between unstimulated and simulated data, and I realized that there was a K-Nearest Neighbors based solution that I could implement with my newfoud computer science competencies. I therefore developed Sconify, a now BioConductor package that allows for these visualizations. There were many use cases, and I spent the remainder of my thesis developing this method further and doing various collaborations with it.

This is the k-nearest neighbors of a given cell in the original high dimension space, in comparison to the k-nearest neighbors of a given cell in the embedding. I show that the overlap here is much lower than my audience expected. I've given this talk many times since then, for my clients.

We were looking at what is called the U-Matrix, a way to visualize the self organizing maps that FlowSOM produces. The question was what insights could we derive from using the U-Matrix to visualize the output of very large FlowSOM clusterings (eg. a 100 x 100 grid rather than the default 10 x 10). So far as I know, this is not explored in any major CyTOF publication, so any CyTOF users who use FlowSOM (most people at the time of writing) should have a look at this. There are visualizations in here that are useful but remain unpublished.

Invited Speaker, German CyTOF User Forum; Berlin, Germany; February 2018.
This is the talk version of my 2018 Sconify paper, that ended up being the final chapter of my PhD thesis. There are two aspects to this talk. The first is making visual comparisons of unstimulated and stimulated CyTOF data when looking at measurements of phosphoproteins. This was easily done on SPADE trees, but not t-SNE maps, until I started making k-nearest neighbor based comparisons. The second aspect of this talk is using the same nearest neighbor based comparisons to investigate batch effects in CyTOF data. I note that batch effects were only heavily discussed among CyTOF users starting near 2020 (in my circles), and this work goes back to 2016.

Abstract: Due to the rise of high-dimensional single cell technologies in the past few years, there has been an increasing number of both computational methods and workflows to analyze the new wealth of data. However, non-intuitive properties of high-dimensional space can give rise to analysis artifacts, collectively known of as the “curse of dimensionality.” Increasing dimensions differentially affect the performance of distance metrics, and there is no clear consensus about which distance metrics to use for which analysis strategies. While the influence of many tool-specific parameters has been evaluated, we study here the impact of commonly used distance metrics on the outcome of dimensionality reduction and clustering.

If you have one or two bad markers in your panel (noise), does it completely ruin your t-SNE/UMAP visualizations? According to my analysis so far, no. I take whole blood CyTOF data (22 dimensions) and add extra dimensions of random normal distributions, running t-SNE after each new column has been added (I've done UMAP too). What I have found:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A few dimensions of noise do not catastrophically affect the map. Lots of noise dimensions do.</li>
<li>The embedding space shrinks with increased number of dimensions. You have to hold the xy ranges constant to see this.</li>
<li>When you have many dimensions of noise, the map starts to look trajectory-like (look at the end of the gif), which could affect biological interpretation.</li>

This project asks the following question: if you run t-SNE or UMAP over and over for 100 times or more, how different does each map look from each other map? Is each map radically different? Is each map similar? Are there pockets of stability?
</p>

<p>
The spoiler alert is that the island placement of UMAP appears to be more stable than that of t-SNE, but t-SNE does display pockets of stability. This can be more easily seen by ordering the t-SNE runs by similarity.

Other applications using this package include imputation, marker redundancy, and testing the relative information loss of lower dimension embeddings compared to the original manifold.

CyTOF analysis has come a long way. Along with single-cell sequencing analysis, a lot of it is high-level functions that do what needs to be done. I prefer a guts-level analysis, where I can see the low-level the details of how my data are being manipulated. This is important for understanding and innovation.

Keeping it to one fcs file, we can focus on what happens when a fcs file is read into R, how it is transformed, and what the best practices of clustering, dimension reduction, and visualization are. These foundations can be built upon when looking at multiple fcs files to determine where there are differences in your control versus experiment group.

We make box plots group-level comparisons for clusters we care about. We also color our dimension reduction maps by the p-value information. This pipeline requires a sample metadata file, as well as a marker file. I show you what these look like directly in the pipeline.

Some examples of output for my <a href="https://github.com/tjburns08/knn_sleepwalk">KNN sleepwalk tool</a>.

From the README: "My wrapper allows for the visualization of a given cell's K-nearest (and K-farthest) neighbors. In other words, the cursor is on a given cell, and the cells on the map that change color correspond to a pre-specified number of nearest neighbors in the original high-dimensional space." See notebooks in my repo to see the data and code. What to do with the visuals below:

<p>
Which distance metrics are right for your data analysis. While I've created a poster on this <a href="https://tjburns08.github.io/final_distance.project.poster.pdf">here</a>, this is a stab at it from a different direction. I make synthetic CyTOF-like data, varying the dimensionality from 2 to 1000. I make a distance matrix for each distance metric used, and then correlate each one to that of the Euclidean distance matrix, which is often a default. The results are counter-intuitive.

If you want the means of your markers per cluster, be careful how you export the data. If you export the means of the raw values per cluster, and take the asinh(x/5) transform of that, the values will be different than if you take the means of the asinh(x/5) transformed data per cluster. The latter is the right way to do it. But don't take my word for it. Look at the markdown yourself.

We find that Fox News in general reports heavily on the topic of politics in comparison to CNN and AP, and that while AP is supposed to be neutral, there are still regions of news space that are heavy in AP content.

In the age of big data, my bioinformatics analyses often lead to output that is still too much for a human to extract insight from.

I then subset the map by traits associated with the genes the user inputs, coloring the points accordingly. One can quickly know what contexts, rather than traits, the genes share.

The scientific literature is overwhelming, and knowing how to utilize text mining and analytic tools can help you efficiently get what you want out of a literature search. Here, I utilize the PubMed API to find publication rates for particular topics. I show that among other things, single-cell sequencing began out-pacing mass cytometry in 2016.

You are only as good as the questions you ask yourself and others. My uncle told me that many years ago when I was getting started with my career and it stuck. This has been relevant to me in terms of having and maintaining good friendships, being a good husband, being a good family member, being a good businessman, and when I was in graduate school, being a good scientist, and simply being an interesting person. I have a very large list of questions now that is very overwhelming. So I turned them into an embedding using the BERT language model, turned that into a nearest neighbor graph, and then derived insight from looking at the questions in terms of "communities."

In essence, when I come across something that feels like its part of the path forward, but can't fully articulate why, I say "there's some signal there" and then I put it in my back pocket. This essay tells the story of how doing this from my teenage years onwards, has contributed to a lot of my good decisions thus far.

<p>
An un-word is a word that points to that which cannot be put into words. We see examples of this in religion, where words like Tao and God are meant to point us to a vastness that is beyond anything we can possibly understand. The Christian concept of fear of God, as seen through this lens, reflects the horror and awe that comes from admitting ignorance and embracing the unknown. This is the beginning of wisdom.

There are two modes that we operate in: the doing mode and the getting-done mode. The doing mode is like a hike, where the focus is on the hike itself and not point A to point B. The is opposed to a commute, the getting-done mode, where you're focused on getting from point A to point B. Here, I argue that the doing mode is being wrestled away from us, and we are wasting our lives in the getting-done mode. We are going to deeply regret this.

Learning computer science improved both my focus and my thinking, which has contributed to a lot of my success from the end of graduate school until now. This matters because I think one should still learn the basics of how to code even if AI automates all of it in the future. This is because inherent in computer science education is the concept of computational thinking, a skill which you should have whether you use it to code, organize your thoughts, or prompt the latest AI. Even the first few months of computer science drastically helped me improve my thinking in this regard. This essay goes into the concepts around computational thinking, and tells you how you can learn it too, in a shorter time than you think.

One of the key components to my method of solving problems is to get into the flow state. When I'm there, some or all of the problem at hand solves itself. And it feels great. I show examples of me doing this. I talk about Taoism as an ancient philosophy built around flow state, but at the macro level rather than the "within-game" level. This is the ideal of being in a perpetual flow state that lasts one's entire lifetime.

I find that if I'm driving stick rather than automatic, I'm much more connected to what I'm doing, much more satisfied in the moment, and I'm objectively a better driver as a result.This concept generalizes. Pick an endeavor. Complete the analogy: automatic transmission is to your endeavor as manual transmission is to X. If you know how to do X, do it when you can. If you don't know how to do X, then learn it. I give several examples of this in my life, and I conclude by encouraging others to embody this way of doing things.

What happens under the hood when you do something simple in R, like add two numbers together? Here, I start with just that. I then show that arithmetic in R is actually parsed as S-expressions. I then go into LISP, where S-expressions are a hallmark. I then move into the source code of R, where the S-expressions for arithmetic are written, in C. And from there, I go into Assembly, the human-readable version of machine code that C is compiled into. By breaking down these layers, and going down the rabbit hole, this exercise gets us to first principles. These are foundational concepts from which we can reason and solve problems more effectively.

When I started learning Lisp, I learned of the concept of metaprogramming. This means using code to change the programming language itself.

Here, I show you how to change the syntax of R to fit your fancy. I show you how to change the "+" operator in ggplot2, and to zero-index vectors, as they're done in many other programming languages.

Class 4, where things like Turing completeness happen, shows up at or near these pockets, surrounded by Class 2 (repetitive, orderly). This supports the idea of Class 4 being "at the edge of chaos."

What are the fundamental units of a computer? Logic gates. I show what these are. I then show that they can be created with combinations of a single type of logic gate: NAND (Not AND). In other words, you can make a general-purpose computer if you had enough NAND gates and wires. In the spirit of this, I combine NAND gates to create a calculator that can add large numbers. One of the key points in this exercise is that it does not take much to get from NAND gates to complex computations.

I talk about experiences where I've had food that tastes so good that it makes me feel uneasy, like I'm going to become addicted. I call this hyper-yummy food. From this comes the idea of making your diet more boring, less yummy, as a first step to taking control of your nutrition, as opposed to cutting calories.

My approach to health and fitness is not the goal-directed approach that seems to be prevalent everywhere these days. Rather, it's more of a flow-based approach rooted in Taoism, and taking elements from modern books like James Clear's Atomic Habits. This has worked for me for decades, and allows me to get my dopamine from the process of working out rather than the outcome. This is a highly sought after place to be, so I want to share my method in case this helps anyone else find that place too.

Over the years, I have seen people who want to get in shape develop fitness goals that are too much over too little time, which leads to burnout. Here, I provide the opposite perspective, which has worked for me in my adult life. Take your fitness goals and ask: if I had a year to achieve this rather than a month, how would I do it?

There is a renewed interest in Stoic philosophy as of late. It's a great set of tools that I have used for dealing with hardship. But it's 2000 years old. Where are the modern Stoics? They exist, but under a different name: psychotherapists. If psychotherapy was the successor to Stoicism, and there is so much interest in Stoicism, then shouldn't there be an equal amount of interest in clinical psychology and how it can help us? Shouldn't it be something we learn early, and make these tools part of our daily routine, as the Stoics do?

An anecdote from my aunt evolves into a motivational article (mainly written for myself). I describe the art and science of how to start a project and how to keep it going. I talk about how I build psychological momentum. I discuss the concept of Long Content, and how it relates to the neuroscience of dopamine optimization.

Think of these as both newsletters and time capsules. They are not exhaustive, but they do represent the bigger insights and ideas on my end from that time period. I'll note that I was going to do this monthly, but life caught up with me and I stopped early. I leave these articles here as a snapshot of a particular period of time that was actually pretty interesting in terms of the long arc of human history: AI (particularly generative AI, like LLMs) was really taking off. Maybe at the time of reading this, AI has plateaued, or maybe it is still exponentially increasing, with all the debate around it that it had here, or maybe some alien is reading this a hundred thousand years after some rogue AGI killed us all. But either way, these are time capsules that maybe I'll add to here and there for the rest of my life.

<p>
I find that asking good questions is key to orienting you in the right direction. As I get older, I am focusing less on answers and more on questions. Accordingly, here is a growing collection of questions that I have found helpful over the years. It is divided into two categories: lists of questions that have been collected by others, and my independent collection. Most of these questions are attributed to others, as opposed to being unique to me.

<p>
Social media is a way for me to get things off my chest that I think are valuable to the world. Oftentimes, I will have an idea, or a piece of software, or a gif, that will give people unique intuition around a perticular topic, for example in bioinformatics. Rather than spending countless hours turning it into a paper or what not, it is easier to just turn it into a social media post. Having done this for a few years now, I have a collection of social media posts. Rather than having to scroll through each of them yourself, I have organized the ones that matter by topic here.

Webinar.<br />
</p>

<p>
This webinar is the latest iteration of my "dimensionality reduction interrogation" work, which has spanned six years. In this talk, I show the limits of these tools by looking at the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) of a given cell in the 2-D embedding space, and compare it to the K-nearest neighbors of that same cell in the high-dimensional feature space. I look at the averages across a given dataset for a given method to compare t-SNE, UMAP and PCA. I then color the maps by each cell's KNN preservation to look for patterns across the dataset. While I point out some general trends, I conclude that at least some of this depends on the dataset. Thus, I demo my free <a href="https://github.com/tjburns08/KnnSleepwalk">KnnSleepwalk</a> tool, which allows users to deterine the performance of their t-SNE's and UMAPs for their data accordingly.

Here is part 2 of my appearance on the Developer Stories podcast. In part 1, I talked about my transition from biology to programming and bioinformatics in graduate school. In this podcast, I talk about my life after graduation, which started with a big move from Palo Alto, California to Berlin, Germany. I talk about life out here, projects I'm working on, being self-employed, and starting my own company.

An article I wrote in 2020 for the annual Krupp Internship e-newsletter. It was written just after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. It serves as a time capsule for that period, in which many of our basic assumptions about the stability and the future of the modern world were upended. I enjoy looking at it again now and then, as it captures a very unique state of mind. It also captures my wedding, which took place the day before the first lockdown, and included toilet paper as a wedding present.

"Im" is short for "in dem" in German. Not a typo. An article I did for the Stanford Krupp Internship Program, which had huge impact on my life and career trajectory. In a nutshell, I was pre-med prior to my medical internship at the Charite Hospital in Berlin in 2007. Through the internship, I realized that I wanted to do research rather than clinical work. I got my PhD and came back to Berlin to work on the Charite Hospital campus once again, this time as a researcher! I will be forever grateful for the Krupp Internship program and Stanford's Bing Overseas Study Program.

<p>
A game within Conway's Game of Life. You are a blue square that you can move (with arrows), and your goal is to make contact with a "goal" square, colored green, while avoiding all the squares in the Game of Life automata that come at you. Each level up leads to a denser game board. You get five seconds of invincibility (you're colored red) in the beginning of each level, that allows you to get out of the way of any Game of Life objects near you.

Web page.<br />
</p>

<p>
I first came across Conway's Game of Life when I was 16. It completely changed the way I think about how the world works. Or, it helped me realize the way I inherently think about the world. One of those. I consider this the first major event that moved me into the world of computer science later in life. I was above to program this up for the first time in my second intro CS class (Stanford CS106B, C++).
</p>

<p>
Rules for the grid:<br />
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If one cell is alive, and it has 2 or 3 live neighbors, it stays alive.</li>
<li>If one cell is alive, and it has fewer than 2 live neighbors, it dies as if by starvation.</li>
<li>If one cell is alive, and it has greater than 3 live neighbors, it dies as if by overpopulation.</li>
<li>If one cell is dead, then it becomes alive if it has exactly 3 live neighbors, as if by reproduction.</li>
</ol>

<p>
I added a "rule probability" box, that sets the probability that a given rule will proceed for a given cell in the grid at a given iteration. I don't see this in standard game of life implementations, but biological life has a bit of randomness involved, so why not do the same for this?
Aside from that, I have added the ability to modify the rules for the grid. This includes the ability to determine how may layers out you look for nearest neighbors. Note that when you tinker with these settings, most of the automata you get will either be too orderly or too chaotic. The Game of Life rules are a delicate balance between the two.
</p>

<p>
I have also added the ability to modify the size of the grid.
