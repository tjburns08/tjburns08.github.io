<h1 class="title">The mathematician and the hacker</h1>
<p>
A mathematician and a hacker go into a bar in the college town they're in. They just started working together on a cybersecurity research project, and they're still getting to know each other and their respective worlds. They sit at the front, beers in hand.
</p>

<p>
M: Nice bar. Similar in nature to the other one we went to last week, though the barstools are a bit more comfy. And there are a different set of beers on tap, though about half of them overlap.
</p>

<p>
H: This bar is completely different. It's in another neighborhood. The patrons are completely different in character. The bartender is different, and gives off a different vibe. The beer selection is more IPA-heavy. This bar has more food options. There is a billiards table and some dart boards. And plus in that last bar, we were a few drinks in on arrival, and here we're sober, just getting started. So our perception of our previous location is different than now, if not less trustworthy.
</p>

<p>
M: Yes, but you could easily think of the set of all differences as a transformation between the two bars. [gets out a napkin] Bar1 &#x2013;&gt; Bar2, with the arrow being a set of things that change: {beer selection 1 -&gt; beer selection 2; bartender 1 -&gt; bartender 2; neighborhood 1 -&gt; neighborhood 2, etc}.
</p>

<p>
H: Fair. But I'd have a bone to pick about even calling both places a bar. They are enclosed buildings, yes. They both serve alcohol, from a high countertop. This one has an outdoor seating area. This one has more food, as said before, possibly signifying that its more of a restaurant with a bar in it, if you want to use labels. Some people are here for food. Some people are here for drinks. Some for both. But it's not necessarily a place where everyone is coming to party or pre-game for a party.
</p>

<p>
M: But "Bar" is in the title of the both places. They have been labeled "bar." That abstraction is taken care of for us.
</p>

<p>
H: Labels. Abstractions. They cloud base reality. This place could easily be a restaurant but if it pretends to be a bar with food, it will attract more college students on Friday night, along with the families it will attract during the day. Labels are pointers that can be useful, but they are not necessarily true. Especially in a world of perverse incentives rotting out our social system.
</p>

<p>
M: Base reality is math itself. Maybe we just call it "enclosed space for people to consume stuff and chat." E1 &#x2013;&gt; E2. Then the transformations apply just as they did in my first construction.
</p>

<p>
H: Not so fast. In your rush to make everything into a coherent "theory of bar" in order to conform to the notion that math is base reality, you failed to notice that both establishments have the same owner. A simple google search. Didn't even need AI. So anyway the overlap, or the "transformations" are going to be more deliberate, in a way that maximizes profit in both locations, based on the experience and competence of the owner. The transformations are really part of a "theory of how to make people give you money." You know the thing that powers the world and will eventually lead to its self termination.
</p>

<p>
M: Ok, but that's one little detail, that I can put into my grand theory of bar. I have the mathematical structures set up, and all I have to do now is populate it with the nit picky details that you're pointing out to me.
</p>

<p>
H: A very important nit picky detail. You see, you're interested in creating these grand unified theories that explain all of the things. The foundations of the mathematical notation of all things bar with in turn maps to the mathematical notation of all of the things. In complete contrast, I create a new hyperfocused metaphysics with every problem that I'm trying to solve. Similar to meta-programming in Lisp.
</p>

<p>
M: How so? I prefer Haskell, by the way, as so much of it is founded in category theory, which is more or less how I think about the world these days. Haskell is powered and inspired by the very foundations of mathematics.
</p>

<p>
H: You would be into that. In Lisp, rather than solving the problem using the language at hand, the first thing you do is you reject the language as is. You say "this language is not adequate to solve my problem." Then you start defining macros that change the language itself to solve the problem in something that evolves from Lisp to a language that you invented that works specifically for this problem or class of problems.
</p>

<p>
M: That sounds like a lot of work. Why not just use a language that doesn't need that kind of thing. Haskell is such an elegant functional language that I've never had to even think about changing the language itself, aside from defining new functions. But that's standard functional programming.
</p>

<p>
H: The mindset that Lisp gives me allows me to see the whitespace. For example, English is pretty good, but it's missing formal and informal "you." Tu and usted in Spanish. Du and Sie in German. This kind of thing helps if you're recounting a conversation in a mixed group of, say, friends and supervisors. It's also missing a modular ability to develop new words. For example, in German, new words are invented all the time. A flagship example of this is "Schadenfreude." Schaden in this context means "misfortunes" and "Freude" in this context means joy. So the joy at other's misfortunes. Very German. So you just combine multiple relevant words into a new word to express something where there there does not yet exist a word. Anyway it would be nice to have such compoundingfunctionality in English. Though unlike German, I would prefer to have the words be separated by an underscore. Compounding<sub>functionality</sub>. Then of course, we shorten it. Compfunct.
</p>

<p>
M: Very interesting. I'm not really a spoken language kind of person. That's my sister. She has the language brain, and I have the math brain. I'll have to ask her about that. But anyway I think I see where you're coming from. But do you really have to change the language every single time? No one I know does this. No one in this bar is updating English in real time to convey what they want to convey. English is a pretty robust language. I mean, it has imported Schadenfreude from German. Plenty of English speakers use that word these days. Same with plenty of other words from plenty of other languages. That's why preparing to compete in a spelling bee is such a time commitment. That's why the contestants almost always ask for the language of origin when they are given the word.
</p>

<p>
H: Ok, so maybe we don't need to update English all the time, in real time. I haven't had to do that during this conversation. But in general, once you see the whitespace, and you train yourself to see the whitespace in formal systems, you can't unsee it. I'm no longer satisfied with any one language, from English prose to German poetry to python. And to be honest, there might be an ego component to it too. Winning the game by being different.
</p>

<p>
M: Regarding your point on whitespace, the Goedel in me empathizes with that. I can also vibe with that last point, about winning the game by being different. That's the very essence of the PhD, as compered to undergrad. In undergrad, you win by getting higher scores on the test than the next person. In grad school, you win by going down a line of intellectual inquiry that is different than everyone else's. The more different, the better, both in terms of finding something groundbreaking, and in terms of removing competition.
</p>

<p>
H: We might not be so different afterall, at least in this respect. But that said, I'm still going to be biased in favor of looking for differences, inadequacies, and whitespace for insight, as opposed to building up these grand theories rooted in abstractions like categories.
</p>

<p>
M: &#x2026;And this helps you break into or secure computer systems?
</p>

<p>
H: That's a very limited and more Hollywood definition of hacking. See, hacking originally meant ingenuity leveraged toward solving a problem, and especially re-purposing a tool, typically but not limited to software. It's supposed to be the fundamental unit of open source development. That's it. Find some open source project on GitHub or wherever. Commit some change to it that allows it to do something new or better. Now you're hacking.
</p>

<p>
M: That's it? That's hacking??
</p>

<p>
H: It's a rabbit hole, if you think about how clever you have to be to take some existing thing and make it do something new or run better. It's a lot of work, not nearly as glamorous as one might imagine it to be, but it's one of the best feelings in the world. Probably a similar feeling to when you prove a theorem you've been working on for a long time. Not to mention the flow state during the process, probably similar to when you're in the thicket of proving a theorem, and the world just melts away. But anyway the way I do things, looking for things that don't add up, looking for whitespace, and not trying to fit data into a pre-existing model, using the meta-programming philosophy of Lisp, all of that helps me do what I do. It's the same skill set that goes into open source development and cybersecurity alike.
</p>

<p>
M: Fair. Ok, so tell me the current hyperfocused metaphysics you're on now. I'm all ears.
</p>

<p>
H: It's bar sign theory.
</p>

<p>
M: Bar what??
</p>

<p>
H: Bars owned by this person have little funny signs and posters all over the establishment.
</p>

<p>
M: So?
</p>

<p>
H: These signs map to his private life in strange ways. But there's on particular way that is more interesting than the other. They seem to be memory cues. He has a family history of dementia. And he knows it. He's not young anymore. [gets out napkin]. Similar to your previous example, we have: {sign 1 -&gt; cue 1, sign 2 -&gt; cue 2, &#x2026;}. Some of these cues include pieces of passwords he uses for various accounts. He has a similar set of signs in here, that differ from the previous establishment. He doesn't want to store all his mnemonics in one place.
</p>

<p>
M: What?
</p>

<p>
H: The one over there, and that one over there. These two followed by "76" is his facebook password. Or as you might put it: {sign 7 + year of birth -&gt; facebook password}. He doesn't yet use automatic password generation. Or 2 factor auth. Still relies on human memory, despite his doomed condition. Easy to brute force. What do you expect from someone who didn't get exposed to the internet and social media until after his neuroplasticity largely ended.
</p>

<p>
M: How can you&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
H: I'm going through his private messages right now. See, he's cheating on his second wife with one of the local students. Not the first rodeo, by the way. Have a look at this one five years ago. This was right after they got married. His current wife is a former local student&#x2026;one he was cheating on his first wife with.
</p>

<p>
M: &#x2026;
</p>

<p>
H: And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Part of another theory of mine. Quantum Jungian dynamics.
</p>

<p>
M: Um&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
H: Everyone has a Jungian shadow, right? A dark side. Messed up thoughts and feelings that one hopes never sees the light of day. But that's the problem. See, the Jungian shadow jumps up an energy state, for example when someone makes you angry. Then when it jumps back down it emits "shadowons." Particles of evil that others in turn absorb, which lead their shadows to jump up an energy state too, propagating the process. A lot of us don't even notice when it's happening, but another part of us registers it later. Because we are not just one person afterall. To speak your language, we're a category of personaities with morphisms between them. If you want, I'll draw it out in pseudo-Haskell on the napkin.
</p>

<p>
M: You're releasing quite a lot of "shadowons" right now.
</p>

<p>
H: I'm releasing ethicons. A different thing. For another time. The owner just arrived. He's sitting over there to the left. His wife is at home. His current girlfriend is expected to meet him in 5 minutes for some burgers. She's not old enough to drink yet.
</p>

<p>
M: This is so messed up.
</p>

<p>
H: And do you hear the police sirens outside?
</p>

<p>
M: What does this have to do with&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
H: She's 17. I told her parents. The rest is history.
