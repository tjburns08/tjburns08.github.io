<p>
Biological datasets are becoming increasingly complicated, as are the relevant computational tools to process and analyze the datasets.
</p>

<p>
As such, we maintain a "first principles" approach to every project, drilling down on the core concepts that do not change, in the rapidly changing environment that we have all become used to.
</p>

<p>
Whatever the project, we will cut through the "noise" and get right to the core components needed to deliver the highest quality solution.

<p>
Tyler has a PhD in Cancer Biology from the laboratory of Garry Nolan at Stanford University. Starting out as a wet-lab biologist, he developed a passion for software engineering and data science in graduate school, and is now a hybrid biologist, leveraging both domains to solve complex problems.
</p>

<p>
His vision is that good science is upheld as new technology develops. This is a complex problem domain, which he can best address as an independent technology-enabled consulting company.
</p>

<p>
He has been doing consulting for industry since his final year in graduate school in 2016, with single-cell and spatial domain expertise dating back to 2012. His work across various companies in various domains gives him a powerful outsider perspective get you what you need, right now.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf00240d">
<p>
Burns Life Sciences Consulting operates as a decentralized network of top talent in the single cell and spatial fields, amassed over the 12+ years of doing this work, starting with Tyler's work in the lab of Garry Nolan in 2012 when CyTOF and its analysis were still in the "wild west" phase. We have deep experts in each of the domains below at our fingertips.

<p>
The following are brief descriptions of the domains in which we have deep expertise, and through which we provide our services.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org98fcbc9" class="outline-3">

<div id="outline-container-org9ad7c04" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org9ad7c04">Mass cytometry</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org9ad7c04">
<p>
We leverage direct wet-lab and dry-lab experience from the lab of Garry Nolan starting in 2012, when mass cytometry was in its infancy, and the best practices were being developed in real time.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org482dda4" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org482dda4">Spectral flow cytometry</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org482dda4">
<p>
Leveraging our experience in mass cytometry and traditional fluorescnece flow cytometry, we began working and partnering in spectral in the 2020s.

<div id="outline-container-org038cf71" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org038cf71">RNA, ATAC, and related (integration included)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org038cf71">
<p>
Leveraging established best practices and our "first principles" approach from the early days of mass cytometry, we make sure that we deeply understand every detail of our analysis solutions. Our services here include data integration.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org34c8e1c" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org34c8e1c">CITE-seq and related</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org34c8e1c">
<p>
Here, we leverage our work in flow and mass cytometry to make sure the antibody side is done right, and looks right, along with our expertise in single-cell sequencing on the transcript side.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgc800de5" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgc800de5">Spatial proteomics</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc800de5">
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org8949281" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org8949281">Mass tag based (MIBI and IMC), and fluorescence based (codex)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8949281">
<p>
We utilize our direct experience from the Nolan lab and collaborators, where both MIBI and CODEX were being developed at the same time.
</p>

<p>
This is how we deliver the same "first principles" approach that we deliver for our suspension-based analyses. We emphasize getting all the painful details correct, like cell segmentation.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgb94bf6e" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgb94bf6e">Spatial transcriptomics</h3>

</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgb744f02" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgb744f02">Core based (eg. Visium), and cell based (eg. Xenium)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb744f02">
<p>
These methods share principles and methods with spatial proteomic analyis. Again, cell segmentation is critical. There are key differences, and we note that there are a number of different technologies to choose from.
</p>

<p>
We emphasize a general understanding of each one and the respective trade-offs, such that we can help you navigate this field as it develops and give you what you need relevant to your project.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgcc4316c" class="outline-3">

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgcc4316c">
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org729be92" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org729be92">Pathway analysis</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org729be92">
<p>
We determine what pathways are likely active in a given cell subset with specific DEGs. We then go into the pathways themselves and determine what genes within the pathway matter. We emphasize the fundamentals of graph theory in this type of work.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org8fc85c3" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org8fc85c3">Data management</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8fc85c3">
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org0f0cf8e" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org0f0cf8e">Knowledge graphs (eg. Neo4J)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org0f0cf8e">
<p>
Projects in this domain typically involve organizations that have multi-modal data (genes, drugs, pathways, PPI, diseases, and so forth). Knowledge graphs can put all of this together to produce novel insights you won't get looking at these data separately.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org5cf23b2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org5cf23b2">LLM integration</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5cf23b2">
<p>
A typical project in this domain includes converting English into a given query language (eg. Cypher for Neo4J), such that a knowledge graph can be easily queried to deliver actionable insights.

<div id="outline-container-org8bd48f0" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org8bd48f0">What to expect from an engagement with Burns LSC</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8bd48f0">
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<div id="org31ad934" class="figure">
<p><img src="images/2024-09-08_15-25-11_handshake.jpg" alt="2024-09-08_15-25-11_handshake.jpg" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
A typical engagement begins with a mutual nondisclosure agreement, so we can both talk freely. The project can either be fixed (eg. a specific thing needs to be analyzed by a particular time), or open-ended (eg. continuous advisory). When the details, scope, and deliverables are decided upon, then a statement of work is drafted (sometimes from Burns, sometimes from the client) and signed.
</p>

<p>
The project proceeds with a minimum of one video call per week, so we can always be sync'd on progress toward milestones, and any new developments on both sides. Any amendments to the contract after it has been signed can be done in writing.
</p>

<p>
While most of my clients are remote and most interaction is via email, slack, and video calls, I do prefer to have one or more physical site visits per year. In our experience, this makes a big difference in consultant-client relationships and is critical for longer term projects.
