<p>
Biological datasets are becoming increasingly complicated, as are the relevant computational tools to process and analyze the datasets.
</p>

<p>
As such, we maintain a "first principles" approach to every project, drilling down on the core concepts that do not change, in the rapidly changing environment that we have all become used to. This approach allows us to seamlessly integrate the latest tools, such as AI, into our workflows while remaining grounded in fundamental principles.
</p>

<p>
Whatever the project, we will cut through the noise and get right to the essential elements needed to deliver the highest quality and highest value solutions.

<p>
Tyler has a PhD in Cancer Biology from the laboratory of Garry Nolan at Stanford University. Starting out as a wet-lab biologist, he developed a passion for software engineering and data science in graduate school, and is now a hybrid biologist, leveraging both domains to solve complex problems.
</p>

<p>
His vision: by using single-cell technologies, we develop and leverage a deeper understanding of heterogeneity, in order to treat and cure diseases often called heterogeneous (eg. cancer).
</p>

<p>
He has been doing consulting for industry since his final year in graduate school in 2016, with single-cell and spatial domain expertise dating back to 2012. His work across various companies in various domains gives him a powerful outsider perspective to get you what you need, right now.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org14eb30a">
<p>
We build and use custom-tailored data analysis pipelines for each of the listed domains. We focus heavily on common pain points (eg. batch effects, cell segmentation) so you don't have to.
</p>

<p>
Specifically, we can:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>analyze your data</li>
<li>develop and build analysis tools for you to keep (eg. R and python packages)</li>
</ul>

<p>
We have the following options:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Done for you (you do nothing)</li>
<li>Done with you (we provide a helping hand)</li>
<li>Advisory (we guide your data analysis journey)</li>
</ul>

<p>
By working with us, you'll receive actionable insights without having to navigate the increasingly complex "big data" and AI landscapes alone.

We help you avoid common pitfalls and produce reliable data, which makes all the difference when it comes to the data analysis step.

</p>

<p>
The options in terms of delivery are:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I come to you and teach the class in person.</li>
<li>I do the course via videoconferencing (in which case we can extend it past 3 days if you want it to be less intensive).</li>

<p>
The following are brief descriptions of the domains in which we have deep expertise, and through which we provide our services.
</p>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgf44965d" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf44965d">High-dimensional flow cytometry</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf44965d">

<div id="outline-container-org33d9af7" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org33d9af7">Mass cytometry</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org33d9af7">
<p>
We leverage direct wet-lab and dry-lab experience from the lab of Garry Nolan starting in 2012, when mass cytometry was in its infancy, and the best practices were being developed in real time.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org70d8e6f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org70d8e6f">Spectral flow cytometry</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org70d8e6f">
<p>
Leveraging our experience in mass cytometry and traditional fluorescnece flow cytometry, we began working and partnering in spectral in the 2020s.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgd883257" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgd883257">Single-cell sequencing</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd883257">

<div id="outline-container-org39269a2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org39269a2">RNA, ATAC, and related (integration included)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org39269a2">
<p>
Leveraging established best practices and our "first principles" approach from the early days of mass cytometry, we make sure that we deeply understand every detail of our analysis solutions. Our services here include data integration.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org06b1b40" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org06b1b40">CITE-seq and related</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org06b1b40">
<p>
Here, we leverage our work in flow and mass cytometry to make sure the antibody side is done right, and looks right, along with our expertise in single-cell sequencing on the transcript side.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org69e3945" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org69e3945">Spatial proteomics</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org69e3945">
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgacde14d" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgacde14d">Mass tag based (MIBI and IMC), and fluorescence based (codex)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgacde14d">
<p>
We utilize our direct experience from the Nolan lab and collaborators, where both MIBI and CODEX were being developed at the same time.
</p>

<p>
This is how we deliver the same "first principles" approach that we deliver for our suspension-based analyses. We emphasize getting all the painful details correct, like cell segmentation.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgf298fa9" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf298fa9">Spatial transcriptomics</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf298fa9">
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgb95be19" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgb95be19">Core based (eg. Visium), and cell based (eg. Xenium)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb95be19">
<p>
These methods share principles and methods with spatial proteomic analyis. Again, cell segmentation is critical. There are key differences, and we note that there are a number of different technologies to choose from.
</p>

<p>
We emphasize a general understanding of each one and the respective trade-offs, such that we can help you navigate this field as it develops and give you what you need relevant to your project.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org0189e10" class="outline-3">

<div id="outline-container-org2935eef" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org2935eef">Pathway analysis</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org2935eef">
<p>
We determine what pathways are likely active in a given cell subset with specific DEGs. We then go into the pathways themselves and determine what genes within the pathway matter. We emphasize the fundamentals of graph theory in this type of work.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org1566506" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1566506">Data management</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1566506">
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org23013a2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org23013a2">Knowledge graphs (eg. Neo4J)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org23013a2">
<p>
Projects in this domain typically involve organizations that have multi-modal data (genes, drugs, pathways, PPI, diseases, and so forth). Knowledge graphs can put all of this together to produce novel insights you won't get looking at these data separately.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org7520be2" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org7520be2">LLM integration</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org7520be2">
<p>
A typical project in this domain includes converting English into a given query language (eg. Cypher for Neo4J), such that a knowledge graph can be easily queried to deliver actionable insights.

<div id="outline-container-org1418808" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org1418808">What to expect from an engagement with Burns LSC</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1418808">
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>

<div id="org8f79595" class="figure">
<p><img src="images/2024-09-08_15-25-11_handshake.jpg" alt="2024-09-08_15-25-11_handshake.jpg" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
A typical engagement begins with a mutual nondisclosure agreement, so we can both talk freely. The project can either be fixed (eg. a specific thing needs to be analyzed by a particular time), or open-ended (eg. continuous advisory). When the details, scope, and deliverables are decided upon, then a statement of work is drafted (sometimes from Burns, sometimes from the client) and signed.
</p>

<p>
The project proceeds with a minimum of one video call per week, so we can always be sync'd on progress toward milestones, and any new developments on both sides. Any amendments to the contract after it has been signed can be done in writing.
</p>

<p>
While most of my clients are remote and most interaction is via email, slack, and video calls, I do prefer to have one or more physical site visits per year. In our experience, this makes a big difference in consultant-client relationships and is critical for longer term projects.
