<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf1254ce">
<p>
Struggling with slow, convoluted single-cell or spatial data analyses? We provide rapid, next-level insights that transform months-long projects into an efficient pipeline—so you can make decisions fast.
</p>

<p>
We’ve been leading the charge in single-cell and spatial analysis since the early 2010s, pioneering CyTOF and adopting AI tools (like GPT-3, early access) well before they went mainstream. Our approach isn’t just about handing over a fancy report; we teach your team to replicate and refine the process, saving you hundreds of thousands in future service fees.
</p>

<p>
Here’s what sets us apart:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Fast-Track Analysis – We compress your research timelines significantly, going from data to actionable insights in a fraction of the usual time.</li>
<li>Hands-On Training – Your team learns our streamlined methodology, so you remain self-sufficient long after we wrap up.</li>
<li>Future-Proof Expertise – Stay on the cutting edge with our battle-tested AI strategies, honed before ChatGPT took the world by storm.</li>
</ol>

<p>
If you want to accelerate your breakthroughs and empower your team with the latest in single-cell and spatial analytics, reach out now. We only accept a limited number of new clients each quarter, so don’t miss your chance. Let’s make your data work for you—faster and smarter.

<p>
Biological datasets are becoming increasingly complicated, as are the relevant computational tools to process and analyze the datasets.
</p>

<p>
As such, we maintain a "first principles" approach to every project, drilling down on the core concepts that do not change, in the rapidly changing environment that we have all become used to. This approach allows us to seamlessly integrate the latest tools, such as AI, into our workflows while remaining grounded in timeless principles.
</p>

<p>
Whatever the project, we will cut through the noise and get right to the essential elements needed to deliver the highest quality and highest value solutions. And we will show your team how to do it.

<p>
Tyler has a PhD in Cancer Biology from the laboratory of Garry Nolan at Stanford University. Starting out as a wet-lab biologist, he developed a passion for software engineering and data science in graduate school, and is now a hybrid biologist, leveraging both domains to solve complex problems.
</p>

<p>
His vision: by using single-cell technologies, we develop and leverage a deeper understanding of heterogeneity, in order to treat and cure diseases often called heterogeneous (eg. cancer).
</p>

<p>
He has been doing consulting for industry since his final year in graduate school in 2016, with single-cell and spatial domain expertise dating back to 2012. His work across various companies in various domains gives him a powerful outsider perspective to get you what you need, right now.

<p>
Struggling with slow, convoluted pipelines and issues like batch effects? We build and use custom-tailored data analysis pipelines for each of the listed domains. We focus heavily on common pain points (eg. batch effects, cell segmentation) so you don't have to.
</p>

<p>
Specifically, we can:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Analyze Your Data: Hand it over and let us handle the heavy lifting.</li>
<li>Build and Transfer Tools: Need bespoke R or Python packages? We’ll develop them for you to keep.</li>
</ul>

<p>
We have the following options:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Done for you: you do nothing</li>
<li>Done with you: we provide a helping hand</li>
<li>Advisory: we guide your data analysis journey</li>
</ul>

<p>
Regardless of the option above, we will show you exactly how it's done, free of charge.

The following are brief descriptions of the domains in which we have deep expertise, and through which we provide our services.

<h4 id="org25479e1">Mass cytometry</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org25479e1">
<p>
We leverage direct wet-lab and dry-lab experience from the lab of Garry Nolan starting in 2012, when mass cytometry was in its infancy, and the best practices were being developed in real time.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org0fa7265" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org0fa7265">Spectral flow cytometry</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org0fa7265">

<h4 id="org5e36dc0">RNA, ATAC, and related (integration included)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5e36dc0">
<p>
Leveraging established best practices and our "first principles" approach from the early days of mass cytometry, we make sure that we deeply understand every detail of our analysis solutions. Our services here include data integration.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgb7d521d" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgb7d521d">CITE-seq and related</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb7d521d">
<p>
Here, we leverage our work in flow and mass cytometry to make sure the antibody side is done right, and looks right, along with our expertise in single-cell sequencing on the transcript side.
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-orgf101481" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgf101481">Spatial proteomics</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf101481">

<h4 id="org1e258bc">Mass tag based (MIBI and IMC), and fluorescence based (codex)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1e258bc">
<p>
We utilize our direct experience from the Nolan lab and collaborators, where both MIBI and CODEX were being developed at the same time.
</p>

<p>
This is how we deliver the same "first principles" approach that we deliver for our suspension-based analyses. We emphasize getting all the painful details correct, like cell segmentation.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orga770baa" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orga770baa">Spatial transcriptomics</h3>

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8f2f750">
<p>
These methods share principles and methods with spatial proteomic analyis. Again, cell segmentation is critical. There are key differences, and we note that there are a number of different technologies to choose from.
</p>

<p>
We emphasize a general understanding of each one and the respective trade-offs, such that we can help you navigate this field as it develops and give you what you need relevant to your project.

<h4 id="orgfa2bd58">Pathway analysis</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgfa2bd58">
<p>
We determine what pathways are likely active in a given cell subset with specific DEGs. We then go into the pathways themselves and determine what genes within the pathway matter. We emphasize the fundamentals of graph theory in this type of work.

<h4 id="orge279583">Knowledge graphs (eg. Neo4J)</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orge279583">
<p>
Projects in this domain typically involve organizations that have multi-modal data (genes, drugs, pathways, PPI, diseases, and so forth). Knowledge graphs can put all of this together to produce novel insights you won't get looking at these data separately.
</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="outline-container-org390c20e" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org390c20e">LLM integration</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org390c20e">

A typical project in this domain includes converting English into a given query language (eg. Cypher for Neo4J), such that a knowledge graph can be easily queried to deliver actionable insights.

<h2 id="orgbbffec3">What to expect from an engagement with Burns LSC</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbbffec3">

<p><img src="images/2024-09-08_15-25-11_handshake.jpg" alt="2024-09-08_15-25-11_handshake.jpg" />
</p>
</div>

<p>
A typical engagement begins with a mutual nondisclosure agreement (NDA), so we can both talk freely. The project can either be fixed-scope (eg. a specific thing needs to be analyzed by a particular time), or open-ended (eg. continuous advisory). When the details, scope, and deliverables are decided upon, then a statement of work is finalized (sometimes from Burns, sometimes from the client) and signed.
</p>

<p>
The project proceeds with a minimum of one video call per week, so we can always be sync'd on progress toward milestones, and any new developments on both sides. Any adjustments to the contract after it has been signed can be done in writing.
</p>

<p>
Although most of our client interactions happen remotely (via email, Slack, and video calls), we strongly recommend one or more on-site visits per year—particularly for longer-term engagements. In our experience, meeting in person significantly strengthens the consultant–client relationship and fosters deeper collaboration.
