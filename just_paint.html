I. My aunt and painting
</p>

<p>
My uncle and aunt travelled to India for a sabatical. They were there for a few months. My aunt, who is quite the artist, had an idea to "paint India" wherever she went. But when she was there in the moment, getting ready to paint, she would note that things weren't quite the way she wanted them to be. Maybe it wasn't the setting she had in mind. Or maybe the colors she had on the palette didn't quite match what she was seeing. So she wouldn't paint and wait for the next opportunity. And that one wouldn't be quite right either. 
</p>

<p>
Later on in the trip, having painted far less than she would have liked, she realized the conditions for painting didn't have to be perfect. What was more important for the goal of "painting India" was that she just paint. When she adopted this mentality, everything fell into place and she did what she set out to do.
</p>

<p>
I come from academia, where you don't publish until your work is as perfect as you can get it. And even then, the dreaded <a href="https://shitmyreviewerssay.tumblr.com/">Reviewer 3</a> has some bone to pick with what you did. So the perfectionist mentality is still in me, slowing down if not stopping what I do. So I get in a similar mindset to my aunt's, where I keep second guessing myself when I'm in the early stages of a project.  
</p>

<p>
The end result is up until recently either I wouldn't show what I'm working on because it's not to my liking, or I would decide not to do something because I didn't think I'll be good at it or produce something that is "good enough." As if Reviewer 3 is breathing down my shoulder at every waking moment. 
</p>

<p>
II. Showing imperfect work but remaining rigorous
</p>

<p>
At the time of writing, I am 36 years old. I am one year older than my father lived to be. What does that feel like? Although statistically I'm expected to live <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy">several decades longer</a>, it feels like I'm living on borrowed time. What would happen if I died tomorrow? A lot of my thoughts and my work, potential contributions, would die with me. Things I didn't make public because of the academic mentality of hiding things until they're perfect.
</p>

<p>
But I'm working in medical research and bioinformatics. These are fields where you have to maintain a high level of rigor at every level. How do you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic">reconcile</a> this with the idea of something not needing to be perfect to show it to the world? The strategy I'm taking, inspired by <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Psr9tnQFuEXiuqGcR/how-to-write-quickly-while-maintaining-epistemic-rigor">this article</a> by johnswentworth on LessWrong, is to continue being a perfectionist when it comes to finished products, but to share what I'm working on a bit more often. If it's not perfect, I'll talk about where I'm at in the project, what I've observed so far, how I interpret these observations in the present moment, and where I'm going with it.
</p>

<p>
We already do this in academia at lab meetings, internal departmental retreats, and conferences. I think the difference here for me is that I'm simply sharing my work publically a bit more often rather than signing up for a talk for some conference in two months. I'm no longer afraid of getting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Pf8a1a6Ak0&amp;t=31s">scooped</a> (been there), because I am no longer in the academic "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish_or_perish">publish or perish</a>" incentive structure. Even if all my ideas are stolen and published elsewhere, I can still point to them on my website to show my clients how I'm going to add value to their organization. Different incentive structure.
</p>

<p>
Finally, I consider everything I show to be constantly evolving. If you look at the date for this artcile and the others you'll see a date range. Chances are at least for a time, if you come back to this article or any other article on my website, you'll see it change. There is no law against this. We think of blogs, pubications, books, posts, as static documents. Snapshots in time. But what I'm thinking right now, at least in some contexts, is that it doesn't have to be that way. I was heavily inspired here by this piece by AI and tech writer Gwern on the concept of <a href="https://www.gwern.net/About#long-content">Long Content</a>. A lot of my ideas now, that lead to my company's profit and my continued growth, can be traced back to my <a href="./Burns.Dissertation.Final.pdf">PhD thesis</a>. This being said, I often cringe at my old work. As a thought experiment, what would happen if I spent an hour a day for the rest of my life simply revising my PhD thesis as my ideas matured? What would my thesis look like at the end of my life? Not that I'm going to do that, but that is how I plan to treat anything I post. I encourage you to ask yourself similar qustions. What would your work look like if you slowly revised it for the rest of your life, rather than considering it done forever and jumping to the next thing? 
</p>

III. Conclusion
</p>

<p>
Just about every idea we have builds off of the ideas of the past. So I think part of moving humanity forward is sharing what we've got, even if its not perfect. You really never know who it will influence, even if it's only one person who influences someone else, who influences someone else, who influences someone else, who ends climate change by solving cold fusion. It makes me really think about the higher order effects of every action we take. I know there is a lot of randomness in the world, but I at least at take it as a hypothesis that our actions can have profound higher-order influences. It will take a lifetime to test this. What do you have to lose if you think this way?
