#+Date: October 9, 2022 - October 9, 2022

* Notes
Remember, a lot of my value seems to come from the fact that I can code. So my articles should also contain some of that. 

* TODO book review list
* TODO blog/podcast review list
* TODO talks review list
* TODO scientific papers review list
* TODO coffee roasting how-to
* TODO USA expat finance how-to
To stop me from ranting. Just read this article. Then we move on to the next topic.
* TODO it's how-to all the way up
Cynical piece on going from:
thing -> how to video on thing -> how to video on making how to videos -> how to video on increasing your income by jumping to the meta level.
* TODO appreaciation piece: list of friends/family and what they've taught me
* TODO a piece on dog ownership and care
* TODO my thoughts on fitness
* TODO my thoughts on nutrition
* TODO CNN vs Fox News
Order by top 100 liked tweets and you'll get the divide
* TODO science trends
Use biorxv and medrxiv. You've already started here. Focus on actionable insights.
* TODO tracking articles on Bitcoin over the years
Sentiment analysis. See if it differs between dem and republican news sources.
* TODO Life in Germany
* TODO Life as a self employed person. The GmbH, etc.
* TODO how to code. The basics of code.
* TODO how to single-cell.
* TODO "more than you needed to know"
* TODO how I use org mode (generalize it so notion users can do it)
* TODO remote work (I was doing this before COVID), how I'm doing it
* TODO my marketing funnel
* TODO home made dog food recipes
* TODO publish my workout logs
Or at least publish workout insights
* TODO make a how-to home workout blog post
* TODO publish my practice logs
* TODO publish my meal plan
* TODO how I use org mode
I use it in very non-convential ways. I should write a post on this and place in into the Emacs sub-reddit or org-mode subreddit to see if there is some potential impact. It would be tailed toward the org mode user who doesn't want to go too crazy on it yet.

Note that I can also say that Notion is a strong use case for it.
* TODO a study of McKinsey's front page using Wayback machine
Thesis: it's a good way to track what consumers are looking for. We assume they've done the legwork.

Currently: "digital resiliance" "burnout" and "economy that works for all (equality/equity)"

Prelim results: it's complicated. I'll have to do a bit more work on this front.
