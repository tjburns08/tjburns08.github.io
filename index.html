<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc5d23ae">
<p>
<a href="./meditations_chapter_one.html">I</a> am an American CEO and computational biologist who lives in Berlin, Germany. I am best known for my work on knowledge graphs, the limits of dimension reduction algorithms, and single-cell analysis with respect to the many applications of K-Nearest Neighbors. 
</p>

<p>
I run a company called <a href="https://burnslsc.com/">Burns Life Sciences Consulting, GmbH</a>, which allows me to practice open science, work on diverse projects with many organizations, and develop and sell products. The problem is most of my work is behind NDAs so I can't talk about it. There is another large amount of my work that is unpublished, simply because being a CEO has a lot of demands that don't give me the time.
</p>

<p>
This website is a place where I can openly share my ideas and non-client work, regardless of how "finished" it is. I have uploaded written work, code, posters and powerpoint slides of various projects I have driven or contributed to. I intend for a lot of my work here to be "long content" slowly evolving over years if not decades. What matters most is that my thoughts and the work I do that I find meaningful is uploaded here, so when I die (hopefully way down the line) others can easily build off of any worthwhile groundwork I have laid out. 
</p>

<p>
If you have quesitons or comments, or you're interested in working or collaborating with me, just send me a message (see contact info below). I'm always happy to help.

An article I wrote in 2020 for the annual Krupp Internship e-newsletter. It was written just after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. It serves as a time capsule for that period, in which many of our basic assumptions about the stability and the future of the modern world were upended. I enjoy looking at it again now and then, as it captures a very unique state of mind. It also captures my wedding, which took place the day before the first lockdown, and included toilet paper as a wedding present.

"Im" is short for "in dem" in German. Not a typo. An article I did for the Stanford Krupp Internship Program, which had huge impact on my life and career trajectory. In a nutshell, I was pre-med prior to my medical internship at the Charite Hospital in Berlin in 2007. Through the internship, I realized that I wanted to do research rather than clinical work. I got my PhD and came back to Berlin to work on the Charite Hospital campus once again, this time as a researcher! I will be forever grateful for the Krupp Internship program and Stanford's Bing Overseas Study Program.

I make a comparison between the older 2-D platforming games from the 16-bit era and a newer game called Celeste. The key difference is that in Celeste, the gameplay is incredibly difficult, but you have infinite lives. I argue that this type of gameplay is an efficient route to flow state. I describe how this type of gameplay mirrors a lot of problem solving in my professional life. I end by saying that Celeste gameplay is an empowering mental model for doing things outside your competence and comfort zone.

Seurat is an R package that runs single-cell sequencing and related data. Here, I trick Seurat into thinking my CyTOF PBMC data is single-cell sequencing data. I find out that the effective dimensionality of my CyTOF data appears to be much less than the surface markers I am using (15). This is a counter-intuitive result because our features are carefully curated before the experiment is done.

You can parse a fcs file from scratch without flowCore. I read in a fcs file line by line, rather than using the standard read.FCS from flowCore. We can't read the data directly this way, but we can read in the header and the text. For the data, we read in the bytes, convert them into decimal, and then build the expression matrix.

<p>
Abstract: In high-dimensional single cell data, comparing changes in functional markers between conditions is typically done across manual or algorithm-derived partitions based on population-defining markers. Visualizations of these partitions is commonly done on low-dimensional embeddings (eg. t-SNE), colored by per-partition changes. Here, we provide an analysis and visualization tool that performs these comparisons across overlapping k-nearest neighbor (KNN) groupings. This allows one to color low-dimensional embeddings by marker changes without hard boundaries imposed by partitioning. We devised an objective optimization of k based on minimizing functional marker KNN imputation error. Proof-of-concept work visualized the exact location of an IL-7 responsive subset in a B cell developmental trajectory on a t-SNE map independent of clustering. Per-condition cell frequency analysis revealed that KNN is sensitive to detecting artifacts due to marker shift, and therefore can also be valuable in a quality control pipeline. Overall, we found that KNN groupings lead to useful multiple condition visualizations and efficiently extract a large amount of information from mass cytometry data. Our software is publicly available through the Bioconductor package Sconify.

<p>
Abstract: To quantify visual and spatial information in single cells with a throughput of thousands of cells per second, we developed Subcellular Localization Assay (SLA). This adaptation of Proximity Ligation Assay expands the capabilities of flow cytometry to include data relating to localization of proteins to and within organelles. We used SLA to detect the nuclear import of transcription factors across cell subsets in complex samples. We further measured intranuclear re-localization of target proteins across the cell cycle and upon DNA damage induction. SLA combines multiple single-cell methods to bring about a new dimension of inquiry and analysis in complex cell populations. © 2017 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.

<p>
In sum: I started by developing a method to enable flow and mass cytometry to detect and quantify nuclear localization, called Subcellular Localization Assay (SLA), which came out of a collaboration with the lab of Ola Soederberg at University of Uppsala, Sweden.

<p>
In parallel, I was taking computer science classes as a side hobby. I reached a point where I was trying to compare two t-SNE maps between unstimulated and simulated data, and I realized that there was a K-Nearest Neighbors based solution that I could implement with my newfoud computer science competencies. I therefore developed Sconify, a now BioConductor package that allows for these visualizations. There were many use cases, and I spent the remainder of my thesis developing this method further and doing various collaborations with it.

German CyTOF User Forum; Berlin, Germany; January 2020.
In this talk, I measured the accurracy of dimension reduction tools (PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP) in terms of their nearest neighbor overlap. This is the k-nearest neighbors of a given cell in the original high dimension space, in comparison to the k-nearest neighbors of a given cell in the embedding. I show that the overlap here is much lower than my audience expected. I've given this talk many times since then, for my clients.

This slide deck summarizes some work I did with Sofie Van Gassen, developer of <a href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/FlowSOM.html">FlowSOM</a> and all-around awesome person. We were looking at what is called the U-Matrix, a way to visualize the self organizing maps that FlowSOM produces. The question was what insights could we derive from using the U-Matrix to visualize the output of very large FlowSOM clusterings (eg. a 100 x 100 grid rather than the default 10 x 10). So far as I know, this is not explored in any major CyTOF publication, so any CyTOF users who use FlowSOM (most people at the time of writing) should have a look at this. There are visualizations in here that are useful but remain unpublished.

Invited Speaker, German CyTOF User Forum; Berlin, Germany; February 2018.
This is the talk version of my 2018 Sconify paper, that ended up being the final chapter of my PhD thesis. There are two aspects to this talk. The first is making visual comparisons of unstimulated and stimulated CyTOF data when looking at measurements of phosphoproteins. This was easily done on SPADE trees, but not t-SNE maps, until I started making k-nearest neighbor based comparisons. The second aspect of this talk is using the same nearest neighbor based comparisons to investigate batch effects in CyTOF data. I note that batch effects were only heavily discussed among CyTOF users starting near 2020 (in my circles), and this work goes back to 2016.

CYTO Conference; Prague, Czech Republic; May 2018.
Abstract: Due to the rise of high-dimensional single cell technologies in the past few years, there has been an increasing number of both computational methods and workflows to analyze the new wealth of data. However, non-intuitive properties of high-dimensional space can give rise to analysis artifacts, collectively known of as the “curse of dimensionality.” Increasing dimensions differentially affect the performance of distance metrics, and there is no clear consensus about which distance metrics to use for which analysis strategies. While the influence of many tool-specific parameters has been evaluated, we study here the impact of commonly used distance metrics on the outcome of dimensionality reduction and clustering.

This is a guest blog post I wrote for Cytobank. The formatting of the post has since been messed up (image links are broken) since Beckman acquired Cytobank and moved all the web content over. Until it gets fixed, I'm linking you to the original PDF. At the time of writing, there was still a lot of work to be done in terms of really understanding dimension reduction for CyTOF data. As such, I spent a lot of time adjusting inputs (eg. number of cells) and parameters (eg. perplexity) to understand how that affects the resulting map.

<p>
If you have one or two bad markers in your panel (noise), does it completely ruin your t-SNE/UMAP visualizations? According to my analysis so far, no. I take whole blood CyTOF data (22 dimensions) and add extra dimensions of random normal distributions, running t-SNE after each new column has been added (I've done UMAP too). What I have found:
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A few dimensions of noise do not catastrophically affect the map. Lots of noise dimensions do.</li>
<li>The embedding space shrinks with increased number of dimensions. You have to hold the xy ranges constant to see this.</li>
<li>When you have many dimensions of noise, the map starts to look trajectory-like (look at the end of the gif), which could affect biological interpretation.</li>
</ol>

This project asks the following question: if you run t-SNE or UMAP over and over for 100 times or more, how different does each map look from each other map? Is each map radically different? Is each map similar? Are there pockets of stability?

The spoiler alert is that the island placement of UMAP appears to be more stable than that of t-SNE, but t-SNE does display pockets of stability. This can be more easily seen by ordering the t-SNE runs by similarity.

A wrapper I wrote around the <a href="https://anders-biostat.github.io/sleepwalk/">sleepwalk</a> R package. Hover the cursor over any cell in your embedding, and it will show you the cell's k-nearest neighbors computed from the original feature space (as opposed to the embedding space). This allows you to test your assumptions around how exact a low-dimensional embedding (eg. t-SNE, UMAP) is.

CyTOF analysis has come a long way. Along with single-cell sequencing analysis, a lot of it is high-level functions that do what needs to be done.

Keeping it to one fcs file, we can focus on what happens when a fcs file is read into R, how it is transformed, and what the best practices of clustering, dimension reduction, and visualization are. These foundations can be built upon when looking at multiple fcs files to determine where there are differences in your control versus experiment group.

Which distance metrics are right for your data analysis. While I've created a poster on this <a href="https://tjburns08.github.io/final_distance.project.poster.pdf">here</a>, this is a stab at it from a different direction. I make synthetic CyTOF-like data, varying the dimensionality from 2 to 1000. I make a distance matrix for each distance metric used, and then correlate each one to that of the Euclidean distance matrix, which is often a default. The results are counter-intuitive.

If you want the means of your markers per cluster, be careful how you export the data. If you export the means of the raw values per cluster, and take the asinh(x/5) transform of that, the values will be different than if you take the means of the asinh(x/5) transformed data per cluster. The latter is the right way to do it. But don't take my word for it. Look at the markdown yourself.

In this study, we take news articles that correspond to CNN, FoxNews, and AP, from their Twitter handles, and their BERT embeddings, and produce a map of news space.

We find that Fox News in general reports heavily on the topic of politics in comparison to CNN and AP, and that while AP is supposed to be neutral, there are still regions of news space that are heavy in AP content.

The scientific literature is overwhelming, and knowing how to utilize text mining and analytic tools can help you efficiently get what you want out of a literature search. Here, I utilize the PubMed API to find publication rates for particular topics. I show that among other things, single-cell sequencing began out-pacing mass cytometry in 2016. Insight like this helps you see how crowded a field is and especially identify trends.

Here, I lay out my favorite framework for what hacking is, and I provide examples that range from business to sports to computing.

<p>
Plato and the Greek philosophers valued learning geometry as a means to understand and think about the world, despite not using it for practical purposes (like engineering). I see computer science as geometry for modern philosophy. This matters because I think one should still learn the basics of how to code even if AI automates all of it in the future. Even the first few months of computer science drastically helped me improve my thinking.

Finding truth in the real world is much different than finding truth in grad school. Grad school had me working on non-controversial, dry topics that few people in the world worked on. The real world is a lot messier. I talk about the idea of collecting opposing perspectives, steelmanning them, and putting them in dielectic to find higher truth. It's simple in theory, but hard in practice.

One of the key components to my method of solving problems is to get into the flow state. When I'm there, some or all of the problem at hand solves itself. And it feels great.

This is the ideal of being in a perpetual flow state that lasts one's entire lifetime.

I find that if I'm driving stick rather than automatic, I'm much more connected to what I'm doing, much more satisfied in the moment, and I'm objectively a better driver as a result.This concept generalizes. Pick an endeavor. Complete the analogy: automatic transmission is to your endeavor as manual transmission is to X. If you know how to do X, do it when you can. If you don't know how to do X, then learn it. I give several examples of this in my life, and I conclude by encouraging others to embody this way of doing things.

<p>
I lay out the rule space of elementary cellular automata as an eight dimensional dataset. I perform UMAP on rule space and color by complexity measures, the most interesting being the labeled Wolfram class of each rule. Class 3, the most chaotic behavior, shows up as little pockets in rule space. Class 4, where things like Turing completeness happen, shows up at or near these pockets, surrounded by Class 2 (repetitive, orderly). This supports the idea of Class 4 being "at the edge of chaos."

<p>
What are the fundamental units of a computer? Logic gates. I show what these are. I then show that they can be created with combinations of a single type of logic gate: NAND (Not AND). In other words, you can make a general-purpose computer if you had enough NAND gates and wires. In the spirit of this, I combine NAND gates to create a calculator that can add large numbers. One of the key points in this exercise is that it does not take much to get from NAND gates to complex computations.

There is a renewed interest in Stoic philosophy as of late. It's a great set of tools that I have used for dealing with hardship. But it's 2000 years old. Where are the modern Stoics? They exist, but under a different name: psychotherapists. If psychotherapy was the successor to Stoicism, and there is so much interest in Stoicism, then shouldn't there be an equal amount of interest in clinical psychology and how it can help us? Shouldn't it be something we learn early, and make these tools part of our daily routine, as the Stoics do?

<p>
A game within Conway's Game of Life. You are a blue square that you can move (with arrows), and your goal is to make contact with a "goal" square, colored green, while avoiding all the squares in the Game of Life automata that come at you. Each level up leads to a denser game board. You get five seconds of invincibility (you're colored red) in the beginning of each level, that allows you to get out of the way of any Game of Life objects near you.

<p>
I first came across Conway's Game of Life when I was 16. It completely changed the way I think about how the world works. Or, it helped me realize the way I inherently think about the world. One of those. I consider this the first major event that moved me into the world of computer science later in life. I was above to program this up for the first time in my second intro CS class (Stanford CS106B, C++).
</p>

<p>
Rules for the grid:<br />
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If one cell is alive, and it has 2 or 3 live neighbors, it stays alive.</li>
<li>If one cell is alive, and it has fewer than 2 live neighbors, it dies as if by starvation.</li>
<li>If one cell is alive, and it has greater than 3 live neighbors, it dies as if by overpopulation.</li>
<li>If one cell is dead, then it becomes alive if it has exactly 3 live neighbors, as if by reproduction.</li>
</ol>

<p>
I added a "rule probability" box, that sets the probability that a given rule will proceed for a given cell in the grid at a given iteration. I don't see this in standard game of life implementations, but biological life has a bit of randomness involved, so why not do the same for this?
Aside from that, I have added the ability to modify the rules for the grid. This includes the ability to determine how may layers out you look for nearest neighbors. Note that when you tinker with these settings, most of the automata you get will either be too orderly or too chaotic. The Game of Life rules are a delicate balance between the two.
</p>

<p>
I have also added the ability to modify the size of the grid.
