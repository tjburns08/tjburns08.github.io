<h2 id="org19b5c24">About me</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org19b5c24">
<p>
I am an American CEO and computational biologist who lives in Berlin, Germany. I am best known for my work on knowledge graphs, and my work on single-cell analysis with respect to the many applications of K-Nearest Neighbors. 
</p>

<p>
I run a company called <a href="https://burnslsc.com/">Burns Life Sciences Consulting, GmbH</a>, which allows me to do science on my terms, work on diverse projects with many organizations, and develop and sell products. The problem is most of my work is behind NDAs so I can't talk about it. There is another large amount of my work that is unpublished, simply because being a CEO has a lot of demands that don't give me the time.
</p>

<p>
This website is a place where I can openly share my ideas and non-client work, regardless of how "finished" it is. I have uploaded written work, code, posters and powerpoint slides of various project I have driven or contributed to.
</p>

<p>
If you have quesitons or comments, or you're interested in working or collaborating with me, just send me a message (see contact info below). I'm always happy to help.

The scientific literature is overwhelming, and knowing how to utilize text mining and analytic tools can help you efficiently get what you want out of a literature search. Here, I utilize the PubMed API to find publication rates for particular topics. I show that among other things, single-cell sequencing began out-pacing mass cytometry in 2016. Insight like this helps you see how crowded a field is and especially identify trends.

Understanding how authors of a given field are connected can help you identify key individuals to pay attention to. Here is how I utilize the PubMed API to build co-author networks, which lead me to identify thought leaders in a given domain. In this article, focusing on mass cytometry, I identify two types of thought leaders: one exclusive to a particular sub-domain, and one who spans across multiple sub-domains. It is important to know both types when approaching a new topic.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org93648bd">
<p>
Abstract: In high-dimensional single cell data, comparing changes in functional markers between conditions is typically done across manual or algorithm-derived partitions based on population-defining markers. Visualizations of these partitions is commonly done on low-dimensional embeddings (eg. t-SNE), colored by per-partition changes. Here, we provide an analysis and visualization tool that performs these comparisons across overlapping k-nearest neighbor (KNN) groupings. This allows one to color low-dimensional embeddings by marker changes without hard boundaries imposed by partitioning. We devised an objective optimization of k based on minimizing functional marker KNN imputation error. Proof-of-concept work visualized the exact location of an IL-7 responsive subset in a B cell developmental trajectory on a t-SNE map independent of clustering. Per-condition cell frequency analysis revealed that KNN is sensitive to detecting artifacts due to marker shift, and therefore can also be valuable in a quality control pipeline. Overall, we found that KNN groupings lead to useful multiple condition visualizations and efficiently extract a large amount of information from mass cytometry data. Our software is publicly available through the Bioconductor package Sconify.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc2fd953">
<p>
Abstract: To quantify visual and spatial information in single cells with a throughput of thousands of cells per second, we developed Subcellular Localization Assay (SLA). This adaptation of Proximity Ligation Assay expands the capabilities of flow cytometry to include data relating to localization of proteins to and within organelles. We used SLA to detect the nuclear import of transcription factors across cell subsets in complex samples. We further measured intranuclear re-localization of target proteins across the cell cycle and upon DNA damage induction. SLA combines multiple single-cell methods to bring about a new dimension of inquiry and analysis in complex cell populations. Â© 2017 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry.

<p>
My PhD thesis dissertation, from the laboratory of Garry P. Nolan at Stanford University School of Medicine. 
</p>

<p>
In sum: I started by developing a method to enable flow and mass cytometry to detect and quantify nuclear localization, called Subcellular Localization Assay (SLA), which came out of a collaboration with the lab of Ola Soederberg at University of Uppsala, Sweden.
</p>

<p>
In parallel, I was taking computer science classes as a side hobby. I reached a point where I was trying to compare two t-SNE maps between unstimulated and simulated data, and I realized that there was a K-Nearest Neighbors based solution that I could implement with my newfoud computer science competencies. I therefore developed Sconify, a now BioConductor package that allows for these visualizations. There were many use cases, and I spent the remainder of my thesis developing this method further and doing various collaborations with it.

German CyTOF User Forum; Berlin, Germany; January 2020.
In this talk, I measured the accurracy of dimension reduction tools (PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP) in terms of their nearest neighbor overlap. This is the k-nearest neighbors of a given cell in the original high dimension space, in comparison to the k-nearest neighbors of a given cell in the embedding. I show that the overlap here is much lower than my audience expected. I've given this talk many times since then, for my clients.

<p>
Invited Speaker, German CyTOF User Forum; Berlin, Germany; February 2018.
This is the talk version of my 2018 Sconify paper, that ended up being the final chapter of my PhD thesis. There are two aspects to this talk. The first is making visual comparisons of unstimulated and stimulated CyTOF data when looking at measurements of phosphoproteins. This was easily done on SPADE trees, but not t-SNE maps, until I started making k-nearest neighbor based comparisons. The second aspect of this talk is using the same nearest neighbor based comparisons to investigate batch effects in CyTOF data. I note that batch effects were only heavily discussed among CyTOF users starting near 2020 (in my circles), and this work goes back to 2016.

CYTO Conference; Prague, Czech Republic; May 2018.
Abstract: Due to the rise of high-dimensional single cell technologies in the past few years, there has been an increasing number of both computational methods and workflows to analyze the new wealth of data. However, non-intuitive properties of high-dimensional space can give rise to analysis artifacts, collectively known of as the âcurse of dimensionality.â Increasing dimensions differentially affect the performance of distance metrics, and there is no clear consensus about which distance metrics to use for which analysis strategies. While the influence of many tool-specific parameters has been evaluated, we study here the impact of commonly used distance metrics on the outcome of dimensionality reduction and clustering.
