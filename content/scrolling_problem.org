** Introduction

We make the assumption every day that we have to scroll through our feeds. When we do a Google search, or a PubMed search if you're a biomedical researcher like me, we assume that the relevant results will be at the very top of the list. This might work for specific searches, but not broader ones. In other cases, like when we're checking the news or social media, we face an [[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/infinite_scroll][infinite, constantly updating feed]]. We find ourselves mindlessly scrolling through a one-dimensional list, with little if any control over what hypernormal, outrage-inducing content will show up next. We do this because there is no alternative.

I define the set of negative issues caused by the act of scrolling as the "scrolling problem." A lot of data are presented to us as feeds, and in order to "stay updated" we have no choice but to scroll through all of it. This leads us to be reactive if the content has a clickbait element to it (flashy, outrage-inducing). This leads us to be quickly overwhelmed as the feeds force us to rapidly engage in [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Task_switching_(psychology)][task switching]] or simply pay a psychological price due to the negative stimuli in our feeds, both of which can lead to decreased cognitive performance. 

The scrolling problem is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem][wicked problem]]: it is not particularly well-defined, but you know it when you see it. My strategy for solving a wicked problem is to [[./just_paint.org][solve a simpler but related problem]], so I could get some momentum going. In my case, I solved the problem of how to group related texts together in a map. This doesn't remove the need to scroll, but it does allow us to start thinking about alternatives to scrolling.

Specifically, I take any one-dimensional list that you would otherwise scroll through, I use the BERT language model to convert each item on the list into a vector, and use UMAP to convert this vector into XY coordinates. I then use Plotly to view this XY plane as an interactive map. Similar items group near each other. I cluster the map, and then I extract keywords from the clusters, so the map is organized by topics. The user then has a "map view" that can supplement the original list.

** Current solutions to the scrolling problem

First question: is the scrolling problem really a societal problem affecting a large fraction of internet users? Or is it just specific to me? One can answer that by doing a quick Google search of the term "stop scrolling." If you want a more scientific bent to the scrolling problem, type "stop scrolling" into PubMed. And scroll scroll scroll through the results...

*** TODO Context switching and productivity

*** Doomscrolling and mean world syndrome

In doing so, I came across the term [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomscrolling][doomscrolling]]. This is scrolling particularly through outrage-inducing content, leading one to fall into an increasingly bad mood, in which perhaps it feels like society faces impending doom. The wikipedia article I linked is very interesting, in that it puts into words a lot of issues that I have come across when I doomscroll. The first is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_world_syndrome][mean world syndrome]]. This is a cognitive bias that arises from activities like doomscrolling can lead one to perceive the world as more dangerous than it actually is. One can see the gap between perceived danger and actual danger simply by looking at historical data. Steven Pinker does this in his book [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Better_Angels_of_Our_Nature][Better Angels of our Nature]], which allowed me to clearly see how I was falling into the "mean world syndrome" camp.

We can't talk about mean world syndrome without talking more broadly about [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias][negative bias]]. This is the bias we enocounter when we're reading comments to our social media posts. One negative comment can derail us, offsetting 100 positive comments. This negative bias specifically says that negative stimuli have a greater effect than positive stimuli on psychological state. This isn't necessarily tied to memory formation (see the [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollyanna_principle][Polyanna Principle]]). For now, we will focus on psychological state. Part of the scrolling problem is that the act of scrolling, and especially doomscrolling has a detrimental effect on psychological state. The negative bias suggests that it would not take much negative stimuli in one's feeds to lead to a negative psychological state, something that should really be addressed for the sake of one's mental health. The scrolling problem is, at least in part, a mental health problem. 

*** Current solutions to doomscrolling: avoidance and curation

Given that doomscrolling has been defined and is part of the current discussion, meaning that at least that part of the scrolling problem is being addressed, what are the current solutions ot the scrolling problem? One way is avoidance. Limited news and social media. Tim Ferriss coined the term [[https://tim.blog/category/low-information-diet-and-selective-ignorance/][The Low Information Diet]] in his classic [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_4-Hour_Workweek][The 4 Hour Workweek]]. When I first learned about this concept, I brushed it off as absolutely preposterous. I was just out of undergrad and had a bit of a chip on my shoulder. The internet is the future. Knowing everything is our moral duty. If I know exactly what is going on all the time, I will be a better person and make better decisions. Maybe that was actually the case for a time, but if we fast forward to 2022, news has been optimized to maximize for clicks over information content. This means that outrage-inducing stimuli is fair game. Furthermore, even before that, news appears to be generally negative. You don't hear the news about all the people who had a perfectly average or even above average day. One exception to the negative bent on the news is a sub-reddit called [[https://www.reddit.com/r/UpliftingNews/][Uplifting News]], which literally finds and tells positive and feel-good current events.

So there are two solutions to the scrolling problem I have come across so far. The first is limited or no scrolling. The second is to aggressively curate your feeds so they include a fair amount of feel-good content. Make sure you subscribe to subreddits like Uplifting News, and stay away from subreddits like Imatotalpieceofshit. Trust me.

*** Motivation for maps, where my work begins

My work on the scrolling problem aims to give the user a bit more control over the act of scrolling itself. The idea is we can't eliminate scrolling entirely. We have to know at least a little bit of what is going on in the world, so we don't get shell shocked when we get to the store and there is [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortages_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic][no toilet paper or hand sanitizer]] on the shelves. Furthermore, even if we inundate our feeds with positive content, we still have little control over what the next item is going to be as we scroll. Every once in a while, something gets through. There was a time a few years ago where my Facebook feed filled up with heartbreaking stories of animals in shelters who had been abused, sometimes with graphic pictures. I can't tell you if this is a trend that everyone saw, or if a handful of my Facebook friends were sharing things like this. The point is, if you scroll long enough, you're going to get hit by something that drags down your mood, and perhaps your cognitive performance, for the rest of the day.

This is one reason I am focused on turning my feeds into maps. If sensitive political content is peppering the news and you don't want it to distract you from an important deadline coming up, then you just avoid that part of the news map, and check the rest of the news. If you only want to read about tennis and not get distracted by football, then just zoom into the tennis subsection of the sports section of the map. 

** From feeds to maps

Here is what viewing your feed as a map would ideally like: rather than having an endless list of tweets, posts, news articles, search results, emails, TODOs, and things of that nature, you have a map. Passages that are similar to each other are near each other based on context. A tweet about dogs and another tweet about dogs would be near each other. A tweet about cats would be near the tweets about dogs because they are related in the context of "pets."

Focusing on social media, imagine your entire twitter feed is a map. You now have more control. Different regions of the map would be about various topics, from celebrity gossip to sports to social justice. You would have control over where in your "feed" you want to go. You could be able to avoid outrage-inducing content if that's what you wish. You could focus on a particular set of topics in your feed so you don't get "sucked in."

Now imagine you're searching PubMed for every scientific paper for a particular disease you're interested in. There could be thousands of papers. Now let's say your results are a map. AI-based papers are to the northeast. Clinical trial papers are to the south. And so on, with each region of the map properly labeled. These broad searches are a good use case for the map view.

** My text-to-map protocol

The tools needed to convert text to maps are open source and readily avilable if you know how to code. My protocol revolves around the use of the BERT language model (there are alternatives, but this one works well enough and is open source). BERT is a pre-trained transformer that takes any text up to 512 words long and converts it into a 768 element vector. Broadly speaking, you can think of this high-dimensional "context space." Data scientists are used to operating with high-dimensional data like this. We know how to program computers to understand this type of data. However, for it to be human readable, we have to somehow turn these 768 dimensional coordinates into a simple XY plane that we're used to.

That's where UMAP comes in. It is a [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_dimensionality_reduction#Uniform_manifold_approximation_and_projection][non-linear dimension reduction]] algorithm. It takes each 768 dimensional vector and converts it into a 2 dimensional vector. Vectors (texts) that are similar to each other in the 768 dimensional space will be near each other in 2 dimensions. In other words, you end up with a map, where each point on the map is a text you care about. A text that would otherwise show up as part of your endless scrolling ritual. Now you have a bit more control, as your feed is now a map. UMAP is by no means [[./tjb_dimr_talk.pdf][perfect]]. You can't perfectly compress 768 dimensions without losing information, but you'll be able to see in later sections that it is good enough to be useful in our goal of solving the scrolling problem.

There are other technicalities for the interested user (warning: jargon coming). One can do a preliminary step of determining the effective dimensionality of the data by determining how many principal components explain 95% of the variance. In my experience so far, it's roughly 1/3 of the total dimensions. This could increase both speed and accurracy given you're operating with more signal and less noise.

Additional steps are standard in unsupervised learning and useful here. Clustering the data, so we can access it at the group level is convenient here. Extracting keywords from each cluster helps us determine what clusters are the "sports" versus the "politics that will make me upset" clusters. All of this gets visualized on the map.

The map must be interactive and clickable. I'll get into this later, but I'm using the plotly package to produce such maps. The best practices (in my domain) for clickable "maps" come from flow cytometry analysis, which involve drawing "[[https://docs.flowjo.com/flowjo/graphs-and-gating/gw-gating/][gates]]" around populations of interest. Flow cytometry users will most definitely find the "map" solution to the scrolling problem to be intuitive. 

** News space: a context map view of the news

The news is a high-impact low hanging fruit for this type of analysis. I am often bombarded by too much information, as well as hypernormal clickbait. I decided to make a map based on the news article titles to create a "neterws space" that I could query from the map view. The easiest solution to doing this was to use twitter. The major news outlets have twitter accounts. These accounts tweet out articles as they come in, as part of the 24 hour news cycle. The text of the tweets is typically the title of the article in question, followed by a hyperlink. This means that I can get the text of the title of the article without having to click on the hyperlink. I just need the tweet itself. Thus, I can create a news map by means of collecting tweets and using the text as input. I collected twitter handles for the major news outlets, from CNN to BBC. I used the twitter API to collect as many tweets from each handle as I possibly could, in order to create a more nuanced "news space."

*** Prior art: news mapped to location on Earth

In researching what has been done to solve the scrolling problem with respect to the news, I found a handful of sites that take news articles and literally place them onto a world map. At the time of writing this sentence [2022-07-16 Sat 11:52] google has a Google News to Google Maps connection [[https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=1uHqXslGuzi1PEjYPM2eD-gfZWXg&msa=0&hl=en&ie=UTF8&t=m&ll=19.973348999999963%2C64.33593799999997&spn=141.785314%2C351.210938&z=2&output=embed][here]] that achieves this aim. I like this because it allows the user to organize the news in terms of regions. Another one that is quite a bit more in-depth is this [[https://blog.gdeltproject.org/an-interactive-realtime-map-of-the-worlds-news/][interactive map of the world news]], by the [[https://www.gdeltproject.org/][Gdelt Project]], a beautiful undertaking to monitor everything that is taking place everywhere in the world, at the map level. It is a bit overwhelming (which is one of the issues with scrolling I'm trying to solve), but the user nonetheless gets control over which regions will be the area of focus for a given news search. Furthermore, it allows the user to (ideally) see how much of the news is concentrated in a particular country. For example, if there is an election in a particular country, there will be a significant increase in news focus on that particular country.

What I am doing is similar in that the output is a map. However, it is different in that I'm using an abstract "similarity space" rather than a literal map. The benefit there is that articles about inflation will be mapped to a particular region. Articles about how inflation is affecting the price of Bitcoin will me adjacent to that. Articles about Bitcoin in general will be adjacent to that. Articles about Cryptocurrencies including but not limited to Bitcoin will be adjacent to that. So it is a map of how current events are related to each other in context rather than where they are located. I like to think of it in terms of how a conversation would go. Inflation -> Speaking of which...Bitcoin -> Speaking of which...Crypto. 

*** News space: similar news articles are grouped near each other

We start with an observation that answers the most obvious question: are the news articles being grouped together in a meaninful way? We start by looking at the overall map. The map was clustered by [[https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_hdbscan_works.html][hierarchical dbscan]], an algorithm developed by Leland Mciness to be used along with UMAP. It is not necessarily the optimal clustering algorithm to be used here, but it's a good place to start. Keywords were extracted as follows: for each cluster, all the news tweets were lumped together into one large string, and fed into [[https://github.com/MaartenGr/KeyBERT][KeyBERT]], which is a BERT-based keyword extractor, consistent with how I created the vector space from each tweet to begin with. Below is what the map looks like. 

[[./images/news_space.png]]

If you zoom in, you can get some interesting nuance. Here, I show a single data point corresponding to a single cluster corresponding to inflation.

[[./images/inflation_cluster.png]]

This doesn't carry much information on its own, so please click on this link that will take you to an interactive html version of this map, where you can spend some time determining if the articles that are similar to each other are grouped near each other.

[[./images/todays_news.html][News on 2022-07-15 Fri 22:00]]

Now we have a bit more control. I update this every day, giving you a map of the news that you can go through rather than coming face to face with media organizations incentivized to get you to click on whatever it is. Now granted, we're looking at tweets here, which are also incentivized in that manner, but on top of the map-level control, we also side-step any provocative images that would also incite one to click. 

** CNN vs Fox News: overlap in "news space"

One use case within news space analysis is to identify topics where conservatives and liberal news agencies are reporting different things. This can help researchers identify news media bias, as well as help ordinary users become more aware of where the narratives differ on a particular topic. Are there regions of news space that are more liberal heavy or more conservative heavy? To start to answer that question, we look at tweets from the main handles of CNN and Fox News. In doing so, we are making the preliminary assumption that CNN and Fox News differences will be liberal versus conservative. In reality, there may simply be differences at the user level. Maybe not all stories are tweeted out. Maybe only a provocative subset. Maybe this provocative subset differs between CNN and Fox News depending on the agency's standards. But like anything new, you have to start somewhere.

*** There are distinct regions only populated by CNN or Fox News
