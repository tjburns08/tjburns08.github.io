* Our philosophy
#+HTML: <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
[[file:images/2024-09-08_13-45-17_matrix_multiplication.jpg]]

Biological datasets are becoming increasingly complicated, as are the relevant computational tools to process and analyze the datasets.

As such, we maintain a "first principles" approach to every project, drilling down on the core concepts that do not change, in the rapidly changing environment that we have all become used to. This approach allows us to seamlessly integrate the latest tools, such as AI, into our workflows while remaining grounded in timeless principles.

Whatever the project, we will cut through the noise and get right to the essential elements needed to deliver the highest quality and highest value solutions. And we will show your team how to do it.

** Data analysis
Struggling with slow, convoluted pipelines and issues like batch effects? We build and use custom-tailored data analysis pipelines for each of the listed domains. We focus heavily on common pain points (eg. batch effects, cell segmentation) so you don't have to.

Specifically, we can:
- Analyze Your Data: Hand it over and let us handle the heavy lifting.
- Build and Transfer Tools: Need bespoke R or Python packages? We’ll develop them for you to keep.

We have the following options:
- Done for you: you do nothing
- Done with you: we provide a helping hand
- Advisory: we guide your data analysis journey

Regardless of the option above, we will show you exactly how it's done, free of charge.

Result: You’ll make quicker decisions and stay ahead in the “big data” + AI landscape, without having to reinvent the wheel.
** Teaching
*** Introduction to single-cell bioinformatics seminar
Accelerate your team’s proficiency in single-cell analysis with our intensive seminar—delivered in person or online. Over three days, we tackle coding fundamentals, explore popular libraries, and practice real-world analyses.

- Core Curriculum: Understand the "why" behind single-cell bioinformatics instead of treating it like a black box.
- Hands-On Practice: Write simple programs, master the basics of R and Python scripts, and learn to apply no-code tools effectively (because you'll understand them).
- Follow-Up Support: We remain available to help apply newfound skills directly to your current research projects.

Result: A confident, self-sufficient team that can manage and interpret single-cell data—from foundational coding to complex analyses.
*** Tailored mentorship
Not everyone's needs fit into a cookie-cutter approach. Here, we develop a plan that is specific to a team member's learning style and goals.

Result: Team members get the know-how they need to reach their goals in the quickest and most efficient way possible.

The following are brief descriptions of the domains in which we have deep expertise, and through which we provide our services.
** High-dimensional flow cytometry
*** Mass cytometry
We leverage direct wet-lab and dry-lab experience from the lab of Garry Nolan starting in 2012, when mass cytometry was in its infancy, and the best practices were being developed in real time.
*** Spectral flow cytometry
Leveraging our experience in mass cytometry and traditional fluorescnece flow cytometry, we began working and partnering in spectral in the 2020s.
** Single-cell sequencing
*** RNA, ATAC, and related (integration included)
Leveraging established best practices and our "first principles" approach from the early days of mass cytometry, we make sure that we deeply understand every detail of our analysis solutions. Our services here include data integration.
*** CITE-seq and related
Here, we leverage our work in flow and mass cytometry to make sure the antibody side is done right, and looks right, along with our expertise in single-cell sequencing on the transcript side.
** Spatial proteomics
*** Mass tag based (MIBI and IMC), and fluorescence based (codex)
We utilize our direct experience from the Nolan lab and collaborators, where both MIBI and CODEX were being developed at the same time.

This is how we deliver the same "first principles" approach that we deliver for our suspension-based analyses. We emphasize getting all the painful details correct, like cell segmentation.
** Spatial transcriptomics
*** Core based (eg. Visium), and cell based (eg. Xenium)
These methods share principles and methods with spatial proteomic analyis. Again, cell segmentation is critical. There are key differences, and we note that there are a number of different technologies to choose from.

We emphasize a general understanding of each one and the respective trade-offs, such that we can help you navigate this field as it develops and give you what you need relevant to your project.
** Network analysis
*** Pathway analysis
We determine what pathways are likely active in a given cell subset with specific DEGs. We then go into the pathways themselves and determine what genes within the pathway matter. We emphasize the fundamentals of graph theory in this type of work.
** Data management
*** Knowledge graphs (eg. Neo4J)
Projects in this domain typically involve organizations that have multi-modal data (genes, drugs, pathways, PPI, diseases, and so forth). Knowledge graphs can put all of this together to produce novel insights you won't get looking at these data separately.
*** LLM integration
A typical project in this domain includes converting English into a given query language (eg. Cypher for Neo4J), such that a knowledge graph can be easily queried to deliver actionable insights.
* What to expect from an engagement with Burns LSC
#+HTML: <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
[[file:images/2024-09-08_15-25-11_handshake.jpg]]

A typical engagement begins with a mutual nondisclosure agreement (NDA), so we can both talk freely. The project can either be fixed-scope (eg. a specific thing needs to be analyzed by a particular time), or open-ended (eg. continuous advisory). When the details, scope, and deliverables are decided upon, then a statement of work is finalized (sometimes from Burns, sometimes from the client) and signed.

The project proceeds with a minimum of one video call per week, so we can always be sync'd on progress toward milestones, and any new developments on both sides. Any adjustments to the contract after it has been signed can be done in writing.

Although most of our client interactions happen remotely (via email, Slack, and video calls), we strongly recommend one or more on-site visits per year—particularly for longer-term engagements. In our experience, meeting in person significantly strengthens the consultant–client relationship and fosters deeper collaboration.
