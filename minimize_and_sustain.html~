<h2 id="orgdecc317">Introduction: uncertainty and resilience</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgdecc317">
<p>
There have been many events in the past few years that have increased the general uncertainty of where our world is going. We've had a pandemic, war, the rapid incrase of AI's capabilities, and so on. To add to this, one of my clients is an existential risk think tank, so I spend a good deal of time every week thinking about the end of the world.
</p>

<p>
All of this has affected how I see my place in the world and what kind of person I want to grow into in the coming years. This is not me turning into a stereotypical prepper. Rather, it's a question of how can I and the people I care about be maximally resilient to whatever the world throws at us. This is not a new question by any means, but this question now incorporates the fragility of basic assumptions I held about our world.
</p>

<p>
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the lockdowns suddenly made things like the ability to cut hair, do home repairs, and cook your own food highly valuable. This flew in the face of the current push to specialize into a narrow thing that you do every weekday at a workplace so you have the money to buy your way out of every other problem. Furthermore, the value of things like being able to do your own handywork (something not well compensated these days) really showed itself during hard times. It mirrors the book World War Z, where after the apocalypse, previously well paid and respected art lawyers have the be re-trained as plumbers and the like.
</p>

<p>
On the job front, the emergence of ChatGPT has led to all kinds of questions around what jobs will be partially or fully replaced by AI in the coming years. You can see evidence that everyone is using ChatGPT all the time on places like LinkedIn, where suddenly every post is full of emojis that otherwise would never see the light of day.
</p>

<p>
There was a time where data science was the so-called <a href="https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century">sexiest job of the 21st century</a>. And now ChatGPT can really accelerate data science tasks for you. I know this because I'm in the adjacent field of bioinformatics.  What I can tell you is that I was going to subcontract coders for various things at my company, but now I'm using GPT-4 and saving upwards of six figures a year.
</p>

<p>
So where does this leave us? That's what this article is about. Over the years, I've been looking at both the most frugal people and the wealthiest people out there and seeing what they have in common. One thing that I have seen is that while they have their deep specialities, they are also generalists. In this territory, they are also systems thinkers. This ranges from building systems to making systems more efficient and sustainable (eg. closing loops). I have written much of this article around the time the tech layoff started and ChatGPT was becoming widely adapted in 2023. Thus, my focus here is on the latter. I look at what happens when you focus on minimizing (eg. getting rid of inefficiencies) and what what permaculture can teach us about system design and optimization.
</p>

<p>
These principles have helped me become more resilient in the past couple years, expanding beyond my original niche (single-cell bioinformatics consultant) and becoming quite a bit more multi-faceted, both at home and at work. As such, I need to put it down in writing.

<h2 id="org08dca2a">Minimize rather than maximize</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org08dca2a">
<p>
By this subtitle, I am not talking about minimalism per-se. There are plenty of books and articles (and not to mention religions) around minimalist philosophy.
</p>

<p>
I am talking about incorporating "minimize X" into your goals on top of the common "maximize X." This is best explained by showing you some examples:
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org5c49a5a" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org5c49a5a">Money: Maximize profit -&gt; minimize spending.</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5c49a5a">
<p>
Maximize income/profit is something that is always on my mind as a business owner. The problem I face is that there are many ways to maximize profit. Many of them have negative externalities, like pressuring employees to work harder.
</p>

<p>
When I say minimize spending, I am not talking about staying at budget hotels in the bad part of town when you go on vacation, or eating only top ramen. Rather, I am talking about psychology and self reliance. 
</p>

<p>
Minimize spending led me to understand the concept of the hedonic treadmill, that my basline levels of happiness will be the same whether or not I have a sportscar or live in a fancy penthouse. I moved toward self-reliance: I started cooking more rather than going to restaurants, doing my own home repairs (though I'm still a novice here), utilizing open source software, and I'm gearing up to grow my own vegetables next year, to name a few. The thought experiment I am constantly running is "what if I had to do X without spending a penny. What would I do?"
</p>

<p>
I am operating on the hypothesis that these additional skills I'm learning will be able to lead to profit and/or impact (helping people independent of profit) down the line. I understand that a lot of the modern convenience economy is built so this stuff can be automated and outsources so we can focus on our high-value skill set (our job/speciality). I understand that I could spend the whole day doing home repairs (poorly) or tinkering with my Emacs config file (if you know what that is), which would negatively affect the company I have to run. I get that. That is not the point. The point is knowing how to do these things. The point is being resilient, self-reliant, anti-fragile, so you can handle the minor or major disrupations often come with uncertainty.

<div id="outline-container-org8a243b3" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org8a243b3">Decision making: Maximize rationality -&gt; minimize bias</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org8a243b3">
<p>
A lot of operating in uncertainty means being able to make rational decisions. As such, I am trying to work on my rationality overall. Having a goal like "improve or maximize rationality" is a bit broad. However, a lot of rational decision making involves being aware of the cognitive biases that can lead to irrational decisions. This is written about quite a lot on <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/bJ2haLkcGeLtTWaD5/welcome-to-lesswrong">LessWrong</a>, a community devoted to the art of rationality. Notice the mentality is consistent with this article: becoming less wrong rather than more right, something that influenced my "minimization" approach.
</p>

<p>
As such, one way forward is to turn the tables and simply get good at understanding one's <a href="https://biasmap.herokuapp.com/">cognitive biases</a>. There are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">standard ones</a> that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow">Kahneman</a> and Tversky orignally studied (which have since been expanded), but then there are biases that are much more personal.
</p>

<p>
For example, I am trying to de-bias my understanding of <a href="./scrolling_problem.html">current events</a>. I think I read a lot of "fake news" in my college years through my mid 20s, before I became more critical of the news media. I hopothesize that there is some "malware" running in my head from any low-quality journalism I consumed (or perhaps still consume). As such, I am pulling articles from less biased news sources (eg. AP) and seeing what happened in earlier years (eg. 2012) through the lens of AP rather than whatever I was reading at the time. This also addresses more general biases around human memory as well.
</p>

<p>
I am hypothesizing that this de-biasing will allow me to make more rational decisions in the present moment, and perhaps make more accurate predictions of the future. I am critically examining the latter by keeping an excel sheet where I make predictions about the near-term and long-term, so my beliefs can enter a directed feedback system.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgb16b1d7" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgb16b1d7">Music: maximize self-expression -&gt; minimize hindrances to self-expression</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgb16b1d7">
<p>
I am a jazz musician (primarily bass, but currently learning jazz piano). The jazz mindset is one optimized for self-expression. You have to be able to embody the spirit of the music and then play new music on top of it, on the fly (a solo).
</p>

<p>
When I focus on maximizing that (which I have been doing all my life), I spend hours tinkering with different riffs and expressions. While I get really good with self-expression given my technical skills, I do not improve beyond a point. However, when I focus on mimizing hindrances to self-expression, that gets me sufficiently motivated to work on technical exercises, scales, etc. These are the things that help me improve more substantially as a musician. Again, they have always been like pulling teeth for me, but when I flip the script and focusing on minimizing hindrances, I finally have the motivation to do this.

<div id="outline-container-orgaafc4f0" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgaafc4f0">Fitness: maximize strength -&gt; minimize biomechanical inefficiency</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgaafc4f0">
<p>
I have been lifting weights since 1999, and I rarely skip a workout. Earlier, I would optimize for maximum strength. This would be the mindset of no-pain-no-gain. I would give it my all. I still do, but later in life, being more vulnerable to injury, I have flipped the script.
</p>

<p>
If I want to maximize some movement, like the deadlift or the bench press, what I have to do is minimize inefficiencies. In other words, I have to swallow my pride, and use lower weights while optimizeing for form. Once my biomechanical inefficincies have been ironed out, then I can go to higher weights. As a side effect, this mindset has lowered the probability of injury, and has simply made me more athletic and physically resilient.
</p>

<p>
There is a lot more I want to say here, but that will be for a future article.

<h2 id="orgbaf59c8">Permaculture mindset: closing loops</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgbaf59c8">
<p>
I have been researching sustainability a bit more in the past few years. Part of this is cimate change, part of this is due to my uncle being a professor of "green information technology," a field he developed. A lot of these ideas come from the FIRE movement (Financial Independence Retire Early), specifically the works of <a href="https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/02/22/getting-rich-from-zero-to-hero-in-one-blog-post/">Mr. Money Mustache</a> and <a href="http://earlyretirementextreme.com/">Jacob Lund Fisker</a>. The former popularized concepts like "insourcing" and DIY for the sake of frugality, and the latter applied systems thinking and sustainability to minimize spending to the extreme while still having a good quality of life. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture">Permaculture</a>, in my naive understanding of it at the time of writing, is the set of concepts around having a household or community that is sustainable at it can be, ranging from solar panels to regenerative agriculture to reclaiming waste. In systems thinking terms, the outputs are used as inputs somewhere else, whose outputs are used as inputs somewhere else, and so on. 
</p>

<p>
The concept of permaculture has gotten me thinking about how I orient toward the world. I'll focus on the economic sense right now for practicality purposes. The general idea is that for every output I have (well beyond work), I figure out how to "reclaim" that to add value somewhere else. This has a bit of the "reinvest" and "compounding" flavor, but it's a little bit different. I'll provide some examples:
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4174554" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org4174554">Recycle: Journal -&gt; public articles</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org4174554">
<p>
I have been writing in a digital journal since 2009, and a pen-and-paper one since 2006. Some of the writing is personal, but a lot of the writing centers on ideas. For the sake of my company, or for the sake of future employers in a recession where layoffs are around the corner for everyone, it helps to have visibility beyond your resume. As such. One way of doing that is to have a block, substack, personal website, or something of that nature where you can share your work.
</p>

<p>
So I built a website where I can share the things that are important to me. What should I write about? How do I find the time to write? Well, I go into my thousands of pages of journal entries and think of the whole thing as a first draft for articles, books, and whatever else. In the permaculture sense, I am "reclaiming" content that would otherwise be "dissipated as heat."
</p>

<p>
Marketing thought leader Seth Godin is a great example of value reclamation in terms of writing. Whatever he writes he puts in his <a href="https://seths.blog/">blog</a>, where he appears to post every day. He then utilizes material he's already written to write new books. I know this because I bought <a href="https://seths.blog/tim/">This Is Marketing</a> when I was starting my business, and it read like a polished and organized set of blog posts (it was a good book nonetheless).

<div id="outline-container-org5c14328" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org5c14328">Energy efficiency: Services -&gt; productized services -&gt; products</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org5c14328">
<p>
This one is a bit more well-trodden, so I'll keep it brief. We all add value in some way. We all have a sense of what we can do that people will pay money for. With my company, I started out as a general purpose per-hour consultant. I am now slowly productizing my services and selling deliverables rather than my time. These productized services are in turn being developed into standalone products. I am far from complete in this journey, but this is how I am orienting myself. From a permaculture sense, one might think of this as energy efficiency.
</p>

<p>
I was a bit late to the party in terms of productization, but a couple friends of mine who were doing similar things to me when I graduated quickly scaled their services into SAAS products while I was still consulting. That wasn't my path, but both of them have been very successful. 
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgbb1bb8d" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="orgbb1bb8d">Broader impact: Do -&gt; teach</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgbb1bb8d">
<p>
In my company, I originally was getting paid to do single cell bioinformatics. While I still have that as a service, I have added additional services oriented toward up-skilling bioinformaticians in things like unsupervised learning, something that is not always the primary focus of a bioinformatics and data science education.
</p>

<p>
This has three effects. The first is I get to impact more people. The second is that it is a path to productize my services. The third is that it diversifies my value-add portfolio, which from an economic sense makes me more robust. Based on my experience, I think I can add more value teaching than I could just five years ago. I see this becoming more true as I gain more experience. Thus, I expect teaching to become something I do more and more.
</p>

<p>
Consultant <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Weiss_(entrepreneur)">Alan Weiss</a> has this model. He was originally an <a href="https://alanweiss.com/shop/books/hardcover/organizational-consulting/">organizational consultant</a>. He then started teaching consultants how to consult. He wrote some <a href="https://alanweiss.com/shop/books/hardcover/million-dollar-consulting-sixth-edition/">books on that</a>. He then took his experience from writing books and wrote a book on <a href="https://alanweiss.com/shop/books/ebook/breaking-through-writers-block/">writing</a>. He then, as an older person, wrote a book on <a href="https://www.alanweiss.com/threescore/">how to thrive as an older person</a>. You see the pattern. Maybe we're not meant to write books on every aspect of our life, but I'm sure we all have plenty of valuable things to teach. 
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org00c2f0f" class="outline-4">
<h4 id="org00c2f0f">Systems thinking: you are more than your job</h4>
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org00c2f0f">
<p>
I run a <a href="https://burnslsc.com/">bioinformatics company</a>, and that's what puts food on the table. But is that all I am? At some point, I stop working. I have hobbies, responsibilities, friends, and family. In short, I am a human being trying to survive. So is there a better way to think of myself rather than a job title? This is a relatively new idea for me, as my years in grad school consumed me to the point where I was a grad student above all else. But now that I'm away from Stanford, away from Silicon Valley, in the still busy but more relaxed city of Berlin, and married, I know that there is more to me than my job. More to life than my job.
</p>

<p>
These days, I like to think of every aspect of one's life (job and beyond) as interconnected systems with inputs and outputs. For example, my company takes coffee as input to convert bioinformatics data into insights. My family takes the profit from my company as input and converts it to shelter and food. My shelter (apartment) has a balcony, which converts sunlight into vegetables via potted plants. And so on. 
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, the insights from my company's data analysis can be fed back into my company as expanded and increasingly automated products and services. A positive experience from my clients can lead to a good review and evangelism, which can help my sales funnel. A healthy sales funnel will lower stress, which will make me a better husband. You get the idea. 
</p>

<p>
We can take this a step further. A former client of mine was the CIO of a successful biotech company, and also taught group fitness classes at the local gym. So is he a biotech CIO or a fitness professional? Or for that matter a husband and father? Systems thinking allows us to see ourselves as all of the things, and allow us to make decisions that help out more than one system at a time. For example, working out and eating right helps one's ability to teach fitness and perform well as a CIO and have a healthy meal plan for the family. I think this is a healthier way of thinking about who we are.

<h2 id="org805e969">Recap</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org805e969">
<p>
This article is me documenting my thoughts and progress toward becoming more resilient in the face of uncertain times. What I cover is by no means exhaustive, but it is where I am at right now.
</p>

<p>
First, I cover the idea of adding "minimize" to my goals on top of the usual "maximize." I talk about how this has unintended side effects of more clearly defining problems to be solved and orienting myself toward resiliancy.
</p>

<p>
Second, I try to generalize a sustainability and systems thinking mindset that I came across when looking into topics like permaculture. This involves tracking my outputs, and feeding them back into inputs. An example of this it taking my journal articles, which are outputs, and feeding them back into my website, which takes my writings as input and outputs impact and connections (especially ones with future clients and/or employers).
</p>

<p>
As I have hopefully shown, putting these ideas in practice can and has led to personal and professional growth, allowing me to diversify the ways I add value to the world. Had I not been implementing these ideas, there would be a lot less on my website right now, and I would have far fewer connections as a result (among many other things). 
</p>

<p>
This is a work in progress, but I hope some good will come out of it, both at the individual and community level. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go minimize time not spent with my family.
