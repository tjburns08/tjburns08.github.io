A lot of my social media content has revolved around a tool I build called KNN sleepwalk, which allows you to look at the difference between K-nearest neighbors (KNN) of a given data point in the embedding space versus the original high-dimensional space. This kind of intuition is important especially in high-dimensional flow/CyTOF data, where there is sometimes temptation to gate directly on the embedding itself. These posts show you that one should exercise caution when doing such a thing. You can use the method <a href="https://github.com/tjburns08/KnnSleepwalk">here</a>.

Below is a quick way to get hover-linked interaction between UMAP coordinates (or similar) and XY coordinates for your spatial data to see patterns that you may have missed.
</p>

<p>
What this is:
</p>

<p>
The image below is a 10x Xenium brain dataset. The left side is a UMAP from the expression data. The right side is the XY coordinates.
</p>

<p>
With this tool, you hover your cursor over the UMAP and it lights up the corresponding XY coordinates for those cells, changing in real time. This allows you to find subtleties that you might otherwise miss at the cluster level.
</p>

<p>
You can use this today. Just go to my KnnSleepwalk package (GitHub link in comments) and run the BiaxialSleepwalk function.
</p>

<p>
The bigger picture:
</p>

<p>
Based on recent conversations with spatial experts, we need more hover-based interactive data analysis in our pipelines. The Vitessce package shows what's possible, but it does one-to-one linking rather than neighborhood-to-neighborhood linking, which makes it harder to see patterns (example in comments).
</p>

<p>
DM me or comment if:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>You're good with interactive data frameworks (e.g. d3.js) especially those which allow for GPU acceleration (anything involving WebGL, like regl-scatterplot).</li>

<li>You have ideas/feature requests.</li>

<li>You want help implementing this type of infrastructure into your workflows.</li>

You can now use my KnnSleepwalk package to interrogate your spatial data. KnnSleepwalk allows you to interact with your data simply by hovering your cursor over the visualizations. The gif below shows an Imaging Mass Cytometry cancer dataset.

<p>
Left: a biaxial with CDH1 (E-Cadherin) on the x axis and CD68 on the y axis.
Right: the spatial coordinates of each cell.

<p>
Simply dragging the cursor shows you spatial differences that you might have missed if you were simply manually gating on the left, or relying on a color palette on the right.
</p>

<p>
If you work with spatial data: what UI/UX features would you want to see? The feedback I've already gotten is that this needs to work with very, very large datasets.
</p>

<p>
If you are leading a team: let's talk strategy. Tools like this could save you lots of time and provide more clarity in each decision cycle.
</p>

<p>
The big picture: based on the reception this tool and similar of mine have gotten in the past few years, there is an unmet need around interactive hover-and-see tools in single-cell and spatial. We need to add this kind of functionality to our UI/UX's.

UMAP shuffles nearest neighbor rank. Check out David Novak's update to my KNN Sleepwalk package, which shows this.
</p>

<p>
Quick review of KNN Sleepwalk:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Purpose: determine how well nonlinear dimensionality reduction tools preserve a cell's nearest neighbors from the original feature space, cell by cell.</li>
<li>Inputs: original feature matrix (markers if flow/CyTOF, top n PCs if single-cell sequencing).</li>
<li>Output: an interactive map that runs in the browser. Hover your cursor over a cell and it highlights its neighbors in embedding space, and neighbors in original feature space (often quite different).</li>
</ul>

<p>
What we see in this version:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The rank of nearest neighbors (closest, second closest, etc) is not preserved, at least in this example of UMAP with CyTOF data.</li>
</ul>

<p>
What this means for users:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In general, I would discourage subsetting/gating directly in UMAP space</li>
<li>If you have to do this, I would not trust any distinctions made within islands, unless they are made in the original feature space (e.g. Naive vs Memory CD4 in the PBMC 3k dataset, if you know what I'm talking about).</li>
</ul>

<p>
What I am pushing for:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Native plugins in FlowJo, Cytobank, OMIQ, Seurat, and whichever other tools people are using to analyze their flow/CyTOF/single-cell data.</li>
<li>More "interpretability" work for the tools that we regularly use. For inspiration, look at what Anthropic is doing to try to understand its LLMs (link in comments).</li>
</ul>

<p>
Next step:
</p>

<p>
If you do single-cell analysis, use my package (link in comments). If you are a bioinformatics tool builder or researcher, look into interpretability work. If you have any feedback, comment, DM me, or sign up for my online office hours.

Do you need quick and easy intuition around how exact your single-cell embeddings are? Check out <code>knn_sleepwalk</code>, a wrapper I wrote around the sleepwalk R package. Hover the cursor over any cell in your embedding, and it will show you the cell's k-nearest neighbors computed from the original feature space (as opposed to the embedding space). Below is a UMAP of 10,000 cells in CyTOF data with a k of 100. Note that the neighbors are not always nearby. Be careful if you want to gate/cluster on the embedding! <a href="https://lnkd.in/eeqRBdSn">https://lnkd.in/eeqRBdSn</a>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7a53493">
<p>
Flow/CyTOF users and leaders: have you ever wanted to know exactly where a cell on a biaxial plot is on a corresponding UMAP and vice versa? I built a tool just for you:
</p>

<p>
Below is my KNN Sleepwalk tool adapted to compare any plot with any plot. The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) of a given cell are computed in the plot on the left, and the corresponding cells are visualized in the plot on the right.
</p>

<p>
Here, we have a CyTOF whole blood dataset. A CD3 x CD19 biaxial plot is the "root" plot, from which the KNN are computed. The plot on the right is a UMAP, and the corresponding cells are being visualized directly on it.
</p>

<p>
Having an interface like this is one way (of many) to prevent biologists from over-interpreting their dimensionality reduction plots. Thus, I hope that down the line, this biaxial-UMAP real time functionality is available for anyone doing any sort of high-dimensional flow analysis, whether you're doing manual gating or exploratory data analysis.
</p>

<p>
Note that we are just looking at a biaxial vs UMAP. We can do anything vs anything. This includes biaxial vs biaxial. Note also that we can compare a "root" plot to multiple plots in real time.
</p>

<p>
Credit to S. Ovchinnikova and S. Anders for developing Sleepwalk (link in comments), from which I have built these additional functionalities and use cases.
</p>

<p>
I am still building this thing out, so if you have any particular feature requests, please comment or DM me. This tool is for you. Bioinformaticians who are interested in helping out, please DM me. I hope you have a great day.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org63c392a">
<p>
In light of recent scrutiny around UMAP, coming from its controversial use in the All of Us Research Program, I refactored my KNN Sleepwalk project (which I started a year ago) to better reflect the limits of UMAP. Let me explain:
</p>

<p>
This is the PBMC 3k dataset (2700 cells), which is a flagship single-cell sequencing dataset. To the left, hovering the cursor over each cell gives you the top 1% nearest neighbors (27) of that cell in UMAP space. To the right, you can see the 27 nearest neighbors of that same cell calculated from the first 10 principal components, from which you do the clustering and dimension reduction in single-cell sequencing (you can think of it as making the data flow/CyTOF-like, and then doing flow/CyTOF-like analysis on it).
</p>

<p>
You will notice that the nearest neighbors in high-dimensional space are often quite far from the cell in question, speaking to the precision of the map itself. This is worth thinking about when you're looking at the clusters you've made on the map, or thinking about gating on the map directly.
</p>

<p>
The bigger picture here is that I'm getting UMAP to talk about itself&#x2026;to tell me its own limits. This is one way you can better understand what a model can and cannot do. I encourage everyone using UMAP or any complex visualization to do similar things with it. Scientists, PIs, and leaders: please make sure you have a healthy dose of skepticism around tools like these. They can be useful, but they can also be misinterpreted or over-interpreted.
</p>

<p>
Kudos to Svetlana Ovchinnikova and Simon Anders of Center for Molecular Biology of the University of Heidelberg for developing Sleepwalk, which I re-purposed here to visualize the K-nearest neighbors (they developed it to visualize distances). Link in the comments, along with my re-working of it so you can do this on your own work.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5456d1d">
<p>
One way to understand how much global information UMAP can (and cannot) preserve: look at the K-farthest neighbors (KFN) of cells in UMAP space versus high-dimensional space. Here is what I mean:
</p>

<p>
Below is a UMAP from the flagship "PBMC 3k" single-cell RNA sequencing dataset, with 2700 cells. I am using my modification of Sleepwalk (by S. Ovchinnikova and S. Anders, link in comments) to highlight the top 10% farthest neighbors (270) for each cell the cursor is on. This is what is meant by KFN. Left side is the KFN of UMAP space, right side is the KFN of the first 10 principal components, from which you do the clustering and dimension reduction in single-cell sequencing.
</p>

<p>
The first thing to notice is that the KFN in UMAP space and high-dimensional space look nothing like each other, pointing to limitations in UMAP's ability to preserve global information.
</p>

<p>
The second thing to notice is that there is information that is just hard to capture in 2 dimensions. In particular, there is a region to the middle right of the UMAP that seems to be the farthest away from the majority of the dataset, including cells that are quite nearby in UMAP space. One way to make sense of this is to imagine a third dimension where the cells are pointing outward and far away from the rest of the data. But note that in reality we're dealing with 8 extra dimensions here, not 1 extra dimension. Thus, there will be all kinds of complexity at the global level that is hard to capture in 2 dimensions.
</p>

<p>
UMAP claims to capture global structure better than t-SNE, and this topic is a rabbit hole once you start looking at initialization steps for the respective tools. But the point is that global structure is very complex, so even if a tool does a better job than another tool at capturing global structure in 2 dimensions, it doesn't mean that it's perfect. Or anywhere near perfect. Don't let claims like these bias you, as they initially biased me.
</p>

<p>
This post is a followup to my previous "KNN sleepwalk" post, where I compare the K-nearest neighbors of UMAP space versus high-dimensional space directly on the UMAP. If you missed that, please go to the link in the comments.
</p>

<p>
If you want to use this KFN (and the respective KNN) sleepwalk tool for your data and work, please go to the project's GitHub, which I will also link in the comments. If you want me to walk you through its use, just send me a direct message. Thank you and I hope you all have a great day.

<p>
As requested, here are the k-farthest neighbors of a CyTOF dataset side-by-side between t-SNE and UMAP. The cell the cursor is on within the UMAP will map to the corresponding cell on the t-SNE map. Note that they're also all over the place on UMAP as well. Case in point: just because it's UMAP doesn't mean the arbitrary island placement has been solved.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org81a0d95">

The k-farthest neighbors of a CyTOF dataset, visualized on a t-SNE map, are all over the place. Why? Because t-SNE isn't optimized to capture global information. The position of the islands relative to each other doesn't mean much. Keep that in mind when interpreting these embeddings.

A solution to this problem comes out of my thesis work on CyTOF data. Compute the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) of each cell, and then color the map by KNN percent belonging to condition 1. I have a pre-print and a BioConductor package around this, but in reality you just need a few lines of code, which I provide here: <a href="https://lnkd.in/eKkYub7b">https://lnkd.in/eKkYub7b</a>. Just CTRL+F for "RANN."

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org219965e">
<p>
If you run t-SNE or UMAP multiple times, you can see the maps change. To properly use these tools, you need to run them more than once. Let me explain.
</p>

<p>
I ran 100 t-SNEs and 100 UMAPs on the same CyTOF dataset (Samusik bone marrow, 10,000 cells), tracking the position of a single cell across runs.
</p>

<p>
Here's what happened:
</p>

<p>
t-SNE: The cell formed a diffuse ring across runs, showing many plausible placements.
</p>

<p>
UMAP: The cell jumped between two distinct regions, showing more constraint.
</p>

<p>
Why this matters:
</p>

<p>
t-SNE has a very large solution space. The tool optimizes for local neighborhood structure, so the global structure can shift dramatically.
</p>

<p>
UMAP appears to be tighter, but still not deterministic.
</p>

<p>
Visual islands are stable (monocytes will have their own "island" throughout runs), but the total layout isn’t.
</p>

<p>
Key takeaway for researchers and team leads:
</p>

<p>
Run your dimensionality reduction multiple times.
</p>

<p>
Compare not just what islands form, but whether and how relative positions between islands change. Look for patterns that survive the shift.
</p>

<p>
As I've talked about in previous posts, t-SNE and UMAP are useful in terms of seeing the "forest in the trees," but they should not be taken as ground truth (I'll link some of my relevant work in the comments).
</p>

<p>
In future research: I’ll look at how relative island positioning changes when we control for global flips and rotations (something that you see a bit in the gifs below).
</p>

<p>
Seen weird variability in other tools? Leave a comment. I’d love to learn from your observations too.
</p>

<p>
I hope you all have a great day.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org80fb5fd">
<p>
In reviewing the recent "Seeing data as t-SNE and UMAP do" paper, I found out that t-SNE and UMAP are on a spectrum. Let me explain:
</p>

<p>
The Berens Lab at Univesity of Tübingen, Germany developed a method called Contrastive Neighbor Embeddings (link in comments) that generalizes nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithms on a spectrum between more local preservation (t-SNE like) to more global preservation (UMAP like).
</p>

<p>
Thus, rather than running t-SNE or UMAP, and so on, one can sample embeddings from the whole spectrum, which can be obtained by adjusting a particular tuning parameter. Accordingly, users can look at a handful of images across the spectrum and choose the right one.
</p>

<p>
The gif attached to this post is the flagship Samusik mouse bone marrow CyTOF dataset (technically Nikolay Samusik's analysis of Matt Spitzer's data) from the X-shift paper, that I ran through the t-SNE to UMAP spectrum tool.
</p>

<p>
While I have spent a lot of time focused on analyzing the preservation of local structure (the KNN preservation work you've seen from me), getting a feel for the global preservation is important, too, especially in datasets like this one where there are developmental trajectories.
</p>

<p>
In my experience, and also reported by the Berens Lab, there is a tradeoff between local and global preservation for these types of embeddings (KNN graph based), which makes it all the more important to have the whole spectrum in front of you.
</p>

<p>
I provide the code (in the comments) to make these images and gifs, and I encourage everyone to use this tool as well, rather than simply choosing t-SNE or UMAP or whatever is trendy and sticking with it. The more of the spectrum you see, the better intuition you'll get around the data.

As requested, here are 100 t-SNE runs in a row for CyTOF data ordered by image similarity. Notice that there are pockets of stability in the island placement. It's not completely random, as it appeared in the previous post. I would not have realized this had I not done this extra ordering step.
</p>

<p>
How I did it: I took every plot image and made a pairwise image distance matrix using root mean square error as a metric. I then clustered the matrix as you would when viewing it as a heatmap. I then took the row names of the clustered matrix and set that as the new order for making the gif.

If you have one or two bad markers in your panel (noise), does it completely ruin your t-SNE/UMAP visualizations? According to my analysis so far, no. I take whole blood CyTOF data (22 dimensions) and add extra dimensions of random normal distributions, running t-SNE after each new column has been added (I've done UMAP too). What I have found:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>A few dimensions of noise do not catastrophically affect the map. Lots of noise dimensions do.</li>

<li>The embedding space shrinks with increased number of dimensions. You have to hold the xy ranges constant to see this.</li>

<li>When you have many dimensions of noise, the map starts to look trajectory-like (look at the end of the gif), which could affect biological interpretation.</li>

Run t-SNE and UMAP on CyTOF data 100 times in a row. How much does the island placement for each map vary from the previous one? Notice that UMAP is quite a bit more stable. This could be the initialization, or the optimization function of UMAP, which has a "push distant cells away" component.

UMAP on noisy non-trajectory data looks like a trajectory. I add one noisy dimension to whole blood CyTOF data, run UMAP, add another noise dimension, run UMAP again, etc. The map starts to look like a trajectory around 30 added noisy dimensions (biologically, it's not a trajectory at all).
</p>

<p>
If you're looking at a UMAP of an unfamiliar biological dataset (eg. new technology), and it looks like a trajectory, be careful with the biological interpretation. It could just be noise.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orged3d135">
<p>
Here is a post I wrote for biologists and team leaders about my journey from wet-lab biologist to biology-leveraged bioinformatician. In short, I think you can do it too, and if you're working in the life sciences, you SHOULD do it too. You can quickly get to a level where you can understand and communicate effectively with your comp bio team, something that is essential for any project that contains any -omics data. To summarize:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>I started with Karel the Robot (link in post). This is the illustration below. It's what every CS106A student at Stanford starts with. It teaches you a surprising amount of general programming principles that I still use today. Importantly, it makes coding less scary.</li>

<li>I spent a lot of time just trying things (and still do). This was due to the fact that I was initially working with CyTOF data before there were many established best practices and high-level frameworks. Nassim Taleb calls this "convex tinkering" and in my experience, this is better than hand-waving. In the context of bioinformatics, when I try a thing, I am often either wrong or partially wrong about what I thought I was going to see.</li>

<li>When I am completely stuck on a problem, I solve a simpler but related problem. This is a nice trick to keep the momentum going, and to get me into the flow state. The latter is something essential, if not sacred, to my workday.</li>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgc7715cc">
<p>
My survey has revealed that the act of problem solving is a bottleneck for biologists learning how to code. So let me give you a tool that has helped me in the problem solving process over the years, especially when I feel "paralyzed" in the face of a problem:
</p>

<p>
Simplify.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes it's simplifying the problem itself, and sometimes it's solving a simpler but related problem. The act of doing so allows you to get some "psychological momentum." What you don't want is to be paralyzed, and not know what to do next.
</p>

<p>
As an example, I like to tell the story of problem set 3 in CS106A: designing the arcade game Breakout using a Java graphics library. My problem was that even the act of decomposing the problem (standard practice) was stressful, because there were so many pieces that I didn't understand. It was overwhelming to consider everything at once.
</p>

<p>
So I asked myself, could I make a ball bounce around across the walls. No, too complicated. How about just the game window with nothing in it. Ok. That worked. How about the ball in the center of the screen, in place. Ok, that worked. How about if I could get the ball to move one pixel to the right and then stop? That worked too! Now I was getting some momentum.
</p>

<p>
It was in that way that I got to a point where I could do the classic problem decomposition and solve the rest of the problem.
</p>

<p>
So whatever you're trying to solve, try solving a simpler version of the problem, or try solving a simpler but related problem. Keep the momentum going.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb77defc">
<p>
This image is romanesco broccoli. I came across it sophomore year in my dorm cafeteria. The pattern at play was amazing, but&#x2026;hard to put into words. When I was learning how to code, I learned the word for the concept at hand: recursion. Learning how to code has given me many instances of this, where I can reason better about something that was otherwise hard to put into words.
</p>

<p>
In general, learning how to code has improved how I think. It has given me a new lens, the computational lens, through which I can see the world. I wrote and chiseled away at an article over the past year and three months on this topic, and I'm finally ready to share it with you. The article can be boiled down into three main points.
</p>

<p>
The first point is that in comparison to standard wet-lab biology, coding and bioinformatic analysis often involves the scientific method, sped up. A lab experiment used to take me on the order of hours to days, whereas computational experiments (eg. when debugging, analyzing data) take me on the order of seconds to minutes. Accordingly, you can get intuition around something really fast, as well as go through the process of being wrong, figuring out where you were wrong, and improving your thinking so you're not wrong about it again.
</p>

<p>
The second point is that computer science allows you to reason about and operate on topics that are otherwise difficult to put into words. An example of this is "levels of abstraction," where I show you what "hello world" looks like in python (not much stuff), C (a bit more stuff), and assembly (a whole lot of stuff), so you can appreciate the sheer volume of things that get swept under the rug when you write print("hello world") in python.
</p>

<p>
The third point is that in terms of "computational thinking," the computational lens is not meant to replace all other forms of thinking. It is meant to be added to your "latticework of mental models" to use the framing of the late Charlie Munger (link in comments). In other words, you want to be able to look at a problem through as many lenses as you can. I link more material about this in the article.
</p>

<p>
Overall, learning how to code takes time, so don't fret if you've moving forward more slowly than you'd like. This is normal. This said, I do offer a class to get biologists started with programming, with an in-person option and a virtual option. Any labs who are interested, please feel free to reach out. Otherwise, if you want quick (free) advice, feel free to reach out too.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge0eb7c6">
<p>
My survey has already revealed that a large bottleneck for biologists learning bioinformatics is the act of learning how to code, even with plenty of online resources, bootcamps, LLMs, etc out there these days. Let me explain why I think this is the case, based on what I've seen and experienced.
</p>

<p>
For one to do bioinformatics effectively, one must learn how to think computationally. This generally means that one must know how to apply the basic principles of computer science to a problem, like abstraction, problem decomposition, and turning concepts into code. There's a great essay on this idea from 2006 by Jeannette M. Wing that I'll link in the comments.
</p>

<p>
To learn how to think computationally, I had to learn how to independently write code. What I mean by independently is that when faced with a computer science or bioinformatics problem, I would really struggle with it before looking for some sort of answer online (something that's easier now given ChatGPT, etc). It's the equivalent of doing the math problems in school without looking up the answer in the back of the book first. I still keep up this practice today, trying to independently think/work through a problem before I look at what others have done.
</p>

<p>
Coding is a learn-by-doing activity. It is not something that you're spoon-fed. You get better with every problem you solve. I started with very small problems and then I worked my way up. It's a lot of work, and it takes time. But proper guidance early on really helps.
</p>

<p>
One can get started with the foundations of computational thinking in a few weeks with a program called Karel the Robot. It's what every intro CS student at Stanford starts with. It's what I started with. It's what I have people I teach start with. It not only provides a solid foundation but also demystifies what coding and computational thinking is. The concepts and virtues (eg. patience) I learned with Karel the Robot I still use today, ten years later. I'll link a place to get started in the comments.
</p>

<p>
You can't simply become a code-fluent, computationally minded bioinformatician in a single short bootcamp. But you can develop the right foundations that allow you to effectively move yourself forward from that point on.
</p>

<p>
I remember what it feels like to be a wet-lab biologist and be totally overwhelmed with this stuff. As such, I have been teaching people how to learn bioinformatics from the standpoint of a wet-lab biologist. Luckily, my availability is going to open up again this summer, so any labs who are interested, please reach out.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org5e0dfc9">
<p>
After speaking with many labs last year, I determined (as many others have) that there is a lack of bioinformatics support in academia. Thus, many biologists are pressured to learn these skills on their own (as if they don't have enough on their plate already). Aside from the additional stress, this can lead to serious mistakes downstream. Anyone who knows about the replication crises in various fields should be concerned at this point.
</p>

<p>
The good news is, I have also determined that biologists are fully capable of learning these skills. They just need the right guidance. Thus, I have lots of respect for trained bioinformaticians who are going out of their way to teach this material to biologists, and I encourage all of us to teach when we can.
</p>

<p>
How to do it is a complex topic, and I don't think you can go from neophyte to bioinformatician in a few days. But I think providing the right foundations along with proper followup can go a long way. It did take me a long time to learn bioinformatics myself as a biologist, but it did not take long for me to have a solid foundation from which I could already start adding value.
</p>

<p>
I saw this first hand with the lab of Anthony Zamora this past week. I spent three days on site with them, and there is plenty of followup planned. If your lab needs training and/or advising, and your local bioinformaticians don't have bandwidth, please contact me. I wish you all the best.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga6915a1">
<p>
I am tired of the phrase "those who can, do; those who can't, teach." So let me fix it for you. "Those who can, do; those who have done, teach." Three things come out of this:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>If you have experience in anything (which you do), teach it: Yes, there's a lot more educational content these days, but you are specialized in your own way. Just about everyone I know has something unique to say that has not been formalized or at least put in writing. My grandma had all kinds of wisdom that she sadly never wrote down. Thus, I aim to die with everything on paper.</li>

<li>Education is becoming increasingly important: in my corner, from cancer biology to bioinformatics, everything is interdisciplinary now. You have physicians talking to biologists talking to engineers talking to computer scientists, each speaking a different "language" and trying to understand each other. One question I'm asking myself a lot these days: how can I teach in a few hours the mental models that have taken me 10,000 hours to really understand?</li>

<li>Respect for educators: teaching is hard. Communication is hard. You have to figure out a way to operationalize things you may never have put into words. You have to remember what it's like to not know the thing, which may be a long time ago. You have to cater to different learning styles. I don't think teachers (especially in the US) get nearly the respect they deserve.</li>
</ol>

<p>
This can/can't do/teach dichotemy held me back for a long time. I have been in the single-cell world for 12 years now, and I do a lot more bioinformatics teaching now than I used to, borne out of all the experience at doing bioinformatics. It has way more impact, and I love every minute of it.
</p>

<p>
If you're a student, postdoc, tech, or scientist in academia or industry, DM me and I'll give you 15 minutes of free advice about single-cell bioinformatics, any sub-topic you want. Or just say hi. I have nothing to sell you. My paid teaching/training services go to the PIs and group leaders: if you want me to set up a more formal bioinformatics workshop or advisory role for your group/lab, DM me and we'll talk. Site visits are on the table.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdb0c5c4">
<p>
If you do spatial, you know QC is a headache. There's a new spatial foundation model called KRONOS out this week that can help with that. I read the pre-print and spoke with the corresponding author. Here is what I found:
</p>

<p>
Quick overview:
</p>

<p>
This foundation model is a vision transformer (similar to the LLMs, but can "see") trained on high-parameter imaging datasets (e.g. Akoya CODEX). Specifically, it is trained on "patches" rather than cells: 47M patches, across 175 protein markers, across 8 imaging platforms. The interesting thing here is that operating at the patch level can bypass cell segmentation entirely. This helps avoid a lot of headache for the personnel involved, and allows for the capture of nuances (e.g. in neurons that are not perfectly segmented).
</p>

<p>
Deep dive:
</p>

<p>
The part that I was drawn to was Figure 3G-I in the paper (see image), which shows the model detecting and flagging artifacts. These are problems with the image that would harm downstream analysis, like tissue folding, blurring, or signal saturation. This model can be inserted into the quality control section of a pipeline and assist in detecting these issues early on. My previous LinkedIn surveys on single-cell analysis suggest that my audience has much more "headache" around quality control than downstream analysis (and it's the same for me), so I think this is definitely for you.
</p>

<p>
Why I take this seriously:
</p>

<p>
While I have yet to use this model myself, I spoke with one of the corresponding authors Sizun Jiang directly about this, whom I have known since my grad school days. He told me that the model is becoming a mainstay in current analysis pipelines in the lab, and is being used to augment the analysis of previous datasets and ongoing studies. In other words, there is skin in the game here: the better the model, the better his lab's research output, which leads to better publications and more meaningful clinical discoveries, which leads to more grant funding and talent to work on these key questions, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
The big picture:
</p>

<p>
If you are a researcher or a leader, you should look into at least trying these models out, and getting a feel for how they work. Benchmark them to existing analysis pipelines. If you've seen my other posts on foundation models, you'll know that this field is growing fast in single-cell. Now they are being developed in spatial.
</p>

<p>
You'll also know my hypothesis that given the parameter size of the foundation models right now, they may still be equivalent to GPT-2 on the LLM side. Things like larger model architectures or richer training data (e.g. more tissue types, multi-omics) could lead to a "GPT-3 moment." So I would get familiar with these models before we hit this inflection point.
</p>

<p>
What I need from you:
</p>

<p>
Let me know what the most absolutely annoying aspects of spatial QC are for you. Be specific. If I'm going to use this model and similar for my spatial work, I want to direct it toward the nastiest issues and take it to its limits.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orge3c75f3">
<p>
In light of recent work I am doing that requires me to reproduce results from GitHub repos associated with papers (eg. foundation models), I wanted to highlight a paper by Sheeba Samuel and Daniel Mietchen that discusses reproducibility of Jupyter notebooks associated with the biomedical literature (peer reviewed papers, not pre-prints). The results are nothing to be proud of.
</p>

<p>
The authors looked at 27,271 Jupyter notebooks across 2660 GitHub repos linked from 3467 publications.
</p>

<p>
Specifically, the authors looked at:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>22,578 Jupyter notebooks written in python. Of these:</li>
<li>15,817 had dependencies declared. Of these:</li>
<li>10,388 had dependencies that could be installed successfully. Of these:</li>
<li>1203 notebooks ran without any errors. Of these:</li>
<li>879 produced results identical to those reported in the original notebook, and</li>
<li>324 produced results that differed from those reported in the original notebook</li>
</ul>

<p>
In other words, 5.3% of notebooks ran without errors, and 3.9% produced results identical to the paper.
</p>

<p>
One thing (of many) that the authors bring up, and what struck me here, is that the results suggest that the available code had little bearing on the peer review process. And perhaps it should have.
</p>

<p>
From a practical standpoint, I've assisted in peer review, and I understand that the reviewers simply don't have time to dig into the code themselves. So there should probably be ways to make this easier.
</p>

<p>
I think ensuring reproducibility of code in papers could be something that automated tools could do or help do down the line. The methods section of the paper is a testament to this. Given the current "agentic" direction AI is going, this would be an interesting use case to either aid in the peer review process, or be used by the authors themselves to ensure reproducibility at every step of the process.
</p>

<p>
I'll note, given that I use R heavily and therefore use R Markdowns moreso than Jupyter notebooks, I hypothesize that there will be similar issues here. But an important observation from the paper from Figure 19 (attached image, left side) is that the majority of problems were ModuleNotFoundError. This suggests that issues with dependencies cause a lot of the reproducibility problems, something that would generally not surprise python users. R is not without its problems in this regard, but this is especially notorious in python.
</p>

<p>
If you are a biologist interested in how to ensure reproducibility in your code, please let me know. My friends and I have been through enough of this that I have things to say. If enough are interested, I'll make a more in depth write-up.
</p>

<p>
Until then, be sure to use virtual environments (I use renv if in R), and in python be sure to run "pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt."
</p>

<p>
The link to the paper is in the comments. You should read it. There are 30 figures and 5 tables. In the "implications" section they bring up nine talking points (and the peer review bit above is implication 2).
</p>

<p>
That's all for now. Happy new year everyone.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6caa535">
<p>
Transformer-based foundation models (the stuff of LLMs) are slowly working their way into the single-cell literature. Here is what to know and what to do about it.
</p>

<p>
For this post, I draw from a neutral review from Artur Szalata and colleagues (last author: Fabian Theis) on the topic, and additional time I have spent testing these models myself. Below are three main points from the paper, and my take on each of the points, followed by a take-home message to make all of this actionable.
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li><p>
These models are still quite small. Table 1 shows that most of the models reviewed were trained on 30-100 million cells, which translates to hundreds of millions of parameters. Transformer models in other fields are well into the hundreds of billions of parameters (GPT-3 was 175B).
</p>

<p>
My take: the single-cell models here might still be analogous to GPT-1/2, where they show some promise but the full potential is still down the road.
</p></li>

<li><p>
These models serve are multi-purpose tools, in that they have many applications. These include cell annotation, gene function prediction, perturbation prediction, and inferring gene regulatory networks, among others.
</p>

<p>
My take: once these models have their GPT-3/4 moment, there will be many new things for us to play with and integrate into our workflows.
</p></li>

<li><p>
There are applications that are still more suited for simpler solutions. An example of this was scTab, a non-transformer model that outperformed scGPT (a transformer model) in cross-organ cell type integration.
</p>

<p>
My take: from a practical standpoint, I try the simpler solutions first, but in this context, later models trained on more cells could prove to be superior. So I'm keeping tabs on this.
</p></li>
</ol>

<p>
I remember when I got early access to GPT-3 in the fall of 2021 (a year before ChatGPT), experimenting with it quite a bit, and simply making sure I was familiar enough with it that I could rapidly adopt it if it got any better. Now, I am spending time working with some of these available foundation models to see what they can do in my hands.
</p>

<p>
You can get access to these models too by going to Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative's collection of census models for single-cell (link in comments). They provide links to the model pages and sample embeddings that the models produced.
</p>

<p>
The take home message for leaders and scientists:
</p>

<p>
Know how these models work, have some of these tools in your arsenal, and test what kinds of inputs they take and what kinds of outputs they can produce. Keep tabs on their developments. Take their results with a grain of salt, but know that they will get better. I assume that they will only improve from here, as the research around these models improve, and the number of parameters possible per model increase.
</p>

<p>
The review and a markdown of me interrogating one of these models is linked in the comments.

<p>
If any of you are currently tinkering at the interface between single-cell/spatial and transformer models, please let me know. I hope you all have a great day.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7092eb1">
<p>
For spatial transcriptomics data, cell segmentation size is critical. I recently read a 2024 preprint from Austin Hartman and Rahul Satija about benchmarking in-situ gene expression profiling methods (eg. 10x Xenium). There's a detail in here I was struck by:
</p>

<p>
One of the issues with making the comparisons between spatial methods was that the default cell segmentation provided by the authors of the datasets used varied between stringent (only cell boundaries you're sure of, tightly demarcated, small), and not stringent (something of a Voronoi tessellation, with loose and large boundaries). This can be seen in the image below, which comes from Figure 3 (link in comments).
</p>

<p>
The differences in cell segmentation led to artifacts in gene expression, as measured by what they call the mutually exclusive co-expression rate (MECR). This is where genes that are biologically not expressed together in a cell are nonetheless both expressed. They had to re-segment the cells themselves in order to move forward with the benchmarking.
</p>

<p>
This means two things. The first is when you're comparing spatial datasets across methods (eg. Xenium vs MERSCOPE), you need to re-segment the cells with the same method and stringency first. The second is that you need to pay close attention to the stringency of cell segmentation when you're doing any sort of spatial analysis, as it has been shown that artifacts can show up in this step.
</p>

<p>
Do your biological conclusions change if you run the pipeline with loose vs stringent cell segmentation?
</p>

<p>
The bigger picture is that in bioinformatics (and data analysis at large), the devil is in the details. It's all the little things you have to do to make sure the data are ready for the clustering and whatever else you're going to do.
</p>

<p>
If you're in leadership, make sure your team is spending sufficient time on the early stages of data analysis (eg. QC, cell segmentation, batch effect finding, data integration). The "headache" steps that seem to delay the insight generation steps. As Marcus Aurelius said, the obstacle is the way.
</p>

<p>
If you're learning bioinformatics, spend as much time as you can really understanding the raw data. One way to do this is to try to analyze your data outside of any standard package, or take a page from molecular biology and KO (remove) a step in the pipeline and see what happens (eg. what happens to the clustering and UMAP if you don't log or asinh transform the data).
</p>

<p>
As the datasets and methods get more complicated, these little details will become more important. I hope you all have a great day.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org58d59b3">
<p>
Single-cell protein data can take many forms: flow cytometry (spectral or otherwise), mass cytometry, CITE-seq, or protein-based imaging after cell segmentation. Not to mention the multitude of machines (eg. spectral cytometers from different companies, or CyTOF 2 vs CyTOF XT). It is inevitable that there will be a need and efforts to integrate these datasets across modalities to derive actionable insights.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, the Single Cell Omics group at Technical University of Denmark (DTU) has solved this problem with a method they call cyCombine. With this method, they are able to integrate a CITE-seq, spectral flow, and CyTOF dataset. They spell it out in a markdown (link in comments) so you can try it yourself.
</p>

<p>
The UMAPs in the images show that the data, otherwise separate, now sit on top of each other. There are further metrics for evaluating the correction in the markdown (eg. earth mover's distance), and histogram visualizations. If I were using this, I'd want to try gating on the concatenated data, with the points in the biaxials colored by each method.
</p>

<p>
To sum things up, there is good work being done in this space, and we should be paying attention because this type of work is going to become much more important as high-dimensional cytometry and cytometry-like methods and instrument types increase.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org008f310">
<p>
Leaders using single-cell tech: do you have data across multiple modalities (eg. flow/CyTOF and single-cell sequencing) that you want to combine? Are you making large cell "atlases" internally or externally? Then you should consider integrating these datasets with bridge integration, a new method that came out last year. How does it work?
</p>

<p>
Say you have a CyTOF dataset, and a single-cell sequencing dataset. Both are PBMCs. If you have a CITE-seq PBMC dataset (both RNA and protein), then you can use that as a multiomic "bridge" to integrate the two datasets. This is one reason why getting your team to produce a CITE-seq dataset or two might be valuable in the long term.
</p>

<p>
The image attached is a schematic from Hao et al. (link in comments) that shows possible combinations of multimodal integration that go beyond RNA + protein. The method is available in Seurat (in other words, it's standardized and accessible for comp bio). Your team should look critically at figure 5 and S7 in the paper and the text that references it (the page immediately after the figure), as it shows a scRNA-seq + CyTOF integrated dataset using this method, with the text describing sanity checks.
</p>

<p>
Even if you don't use this method, you should note the emerging trend of integration across modalities, which goes along with the emergence of single-cell multi-omics. Importantly, the authors express interest in doing this with spatially resolved data. They specifically mention CODEX (paragraph 4, discussion section), suggesting that a CODEX + scRNA-seq integration might be a current PhD/Postdoc project in the lab.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgea7cde6">
<p>
Life science leaders using flow/mass cytometry: do you want to know where the best practices in data analysis will be in 3-5 years (if done right)? As a flow/CyTOF native, I've been looking to single-cell sequencing for this. Here are 3 things that I think this community has gotten right, that the flow/CyTOF world (that I’ve been part of since 2012) could really benefit from:
</p>

<p>
A dedicated open-source community with well-maintained packages.<br />
On the R side, Seurat is extremely useful, constantly evolving as new methods develop, and well-maintained by the Satija Lab. On the python side, there is scverse, which is a collection of tools that do various things from single-cell sequencing analysis (scanpy) to spatial (squidpy).
</p>

<p>
My recommendation: we model our ecosystem after scverse (bring it all together in one place) and our "end to end" packages after Seurat. Those working with ISAC and similar organizations should dedicate funding to dedicated individuals. I think with efforts like CyTOForum, the community is in place to do this kind of thing.
</p>

<p>
A focus on standards and benchmarking<br />
There's a "single cell best practices" consortium that has a huge free jupyter book, showing you what to do with the scverse and how. Furthermore, there is a lot of benchmarking work happening, e.g., with the scib package from the Theis Lab, that allows you to do your own benchmarking for your data. Long-time flow/CyTOF users will remember the uncertainty around which clustering algorithm to use, that didn't clear up until Lukas Weber and Mark Robinson (from the sequencing world) did a benchmarking study and showed that it was FlowSOM all around and X-shift for rare cell detection.
</p>

<p>
My recommendation: we incentivize benchmarking studies (eg. the FlowCAP project). Especially given the advent of spectral flow, we are going to need an efficient way to redo or build on our prior work as the tools and data evolve.
</p>

<p>
Integration between commercial and open-source methods.<br />
10x Genomics has a UI for its Xenium data. Then they have a page titled "Continuing your journey after Xenium analyzer" listing relevant open-source tools that can help you analyze your data further. Similarly, on the flow/CyTOF side, with Standard BioTools is promoting Bernd Bodenmiller Lab's HistoCat on their page as something to use beyond their UI for IMC data.
</p>

<p>
My recommendation: we build our commercial tools with our open-source ecosystem in mind. I think Omiq's modular design and ability  to quickly integrate the latest open-source tools into its interface is a great example.
</p>

<p>
I'll acknowledge that there are differences between the fields that may impact what has and can get done, like open source community engagement levels, available funding, and the relationship between open-source and commercial solutions in either domain. However, seeing just how much the single-cell sequencing community got right, they can serve as a north star for how we build out our tools from here.

<h3 id="orgeb428c4">The use of LLMs to help interpret PCA loadings</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgeb428c4">
<p>
Friends, leaders, and scientists: how often do you actually use the PCA loadings that come for free in your single-cell and spatial analysis pipelines? Here, we have developed a lightweight pipeline that feeds these loadings (gene lists relevant to each principal component) into a reasoning LLM, to give you a biological interpretation. You can think of this as a supplement to GO/GSEA.
</p>

<p>
How it works:
</p>

<p>
Each principal component outputs a set of genes. When you feed these into a LLM, which can be automated via API use and scripting (see comments), it gives you its best guess as to what a given PC axis is "splitting" phenotypically.
</p>

<p>
Results:
</p>

<p>
As a sanity check, PC1 splits the monocytes from the lymphocytes. But in the picture, you can see that PC9 and its loadings separate out the dendritic cells, and the LLM helped us confirm this. Our report (link in comments) shows that higher-up PCs provide loadings that confirm but might also transcend demarcated cluster boundaries.
</p>

<p>
The bottom line for scientists:
</p>

<p>
Reasoning LLMs have given you an opportunity to fully utilize the PCA loadings that you automatically have in any given single-cell or spatial analysis pipeline, which could potentially give you phenotypic information that goes beyond the standard per-cluster DEG analysis.
</p>

<p>
The bottom line for leaders:
</p>

<p>
This is part of a bigger concept of how the use of AI might help us do biological interpretation of otherwise overwhelming output. At the least, this kind of thing is a nice supplement to the longstanding GO and pathway analysis.
</p>

<p>
Have your comp bio team use the attached markdown to add automated reasoning LLM querying to your data analysis pipelines. PCA loadings are a very low hanging fruit, so start there.
</p>

<p>
Where to find more:
</p>

<p>
The markdown is in the comments below, along with a report that shows you everything the model outputted with respect to loadings 1 to 10, including experiments where we run the same list through the model to see if the output changes.
</p>

<p>
Please let me know if you have any questions or comments. Feel free to DM me. Let me know if you need help setting this up, or if you are doing similar things in your lab/organization.
</p>

<p>
Thank you to my intern Arianna Aalami for driving this project (think of her as the first author and me as the last author).

<p>
To the rest of you, thank you and I hope you all have a great day.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8ef197f">
<p>
Case study: an issue with a bulk sequencing analysis project was quickly found and fixed because of the understanding that "the cell type in question does not behave like that." I can't emphasize this enough: you need bioinformaticians who have wet-lab experience.
</p>

<p>
Aside from finding and fixing issues in the analysis, the "bigger picture" understanding you get serves as a "relevance filter" that sculpts the direction of the project, and how it is communicated (so the client doesn't end up with a bunch of hairball networks that don't clearly answer their biological questions).
</p>

<p>
One tactic you can put your team through today: read papers associated with the data. Oftentimes, projects are continuations of previous work that has already been published. Sounds obvious, but there is a difference between knowing something and doing something.
</p>

<p>
Credit to Christine Nguyen, PhD for sharing this tactic. She has used it successfully over many years working at multiple bioinformatics core facilities, and it has saved her a lot of headache.
</p>

<p>
If you are recruiting, look for people who are cross-trained. This is hard to do. You have to screen for depth on both sides. I am doing this now.
</p>

<p>
If you are a PI/leader who needs this type of analysis, DM me.
If you are a cross-trained bioinformatician, let's talk.

<p>
Thank you and I hope you all have a great day.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1743391">
<p>
Ever wonder if a "boundary" cell in a clustering scheme really fits its assigned cluster, versus the adjacent cluster? Below is one straightforward approach to identify these boundary cells in your data.
</p>

<p>
The problem:
</p>

<p>
A lot of our clustering tools assume that a cell assigned to a cluster is for sure in that cluster. But anyone who has worked with PBMC scRNA seq data knows that there are populations (e.g. CD4 T cells) that are difficult to subset, and therefore hard cut-offs might not be accurate. Same goes for trajectory data. So we need to scrutinize the cells at the boundary regions between clusters.
</p>

<p>
My solution:
</p>

<p>
For each cell, I took it and its four nearest neighbors in PC space (not UMAP space), took their assigned clusters, and computed the Shannon entropy of that. This gives us a value of 0 if they belong to the same cluster and a higher value when the neighborhood is mixed.
</p>

<p>
What you can do with this:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>A visual QC: Visualize the high-entropy boundary regions directly with e.g. UMAP (see image below).</li>
<li>Better downstream analysis: Use the entropy values to down-weight cells in (for example) a ML classifier.</li>
<li>Cluster purity score: Use the mean value of each cluster's per-cell entropy scores (see markdown linked in comments) to determine which clusters need more scrutiny.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Ideas that this builds off of:
</p>

<p>
Spot Entropy (Søren Helweg Dam, PhD thesis 2025), ROGUE (Liu et al. 2020) and LISI (Korsunsky et al. 2019). See details in comments.
</p>

<p>
The bottom line:
</p>

<p>
Take my code from the R Markdown attached in the comments to determine which cells in your single-cell or spatial data need a second look.
</p>

<p>
If there are any similar things you do for your data (e.g. cluster silhouette score), let me know in the comments or via DM.

A related topic worth reading about:
Soft clustering (aka fuzzy clustering). This is where cells are not assigned to a single cluster, but rather have a "membership-ness" score for every cluster. This is done in practice using tools like Gaussian mixture models.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8c1a82f">
<p>
Spatial -omics analysis is complicated. But there is a powerful concept that unifies many seemingly unrelated methods: neighbor graphs. A neighbor graph simply connects cells to their closest neighbors— either based on similarity of gene/protein expression profiles or on physical proximity. If you grasp this idea, you'll quickly gain intuition across key steps like integration, clustering, niche finding, and dimensionality reduction.
</p>

<p>
Here is how neighbor graphs underpin a typical spatial analysis pipeline:
</p>

<p>
Integration:
</p>

<p>
You might be integrating multiple datasets early on. While there are many ways to do this, one of them, called weighted nearest neighbor analysis, or wnn, uses a knn graph of multimodal datasets to predict the "weights" of each modality (eg. RNA vs protein), to determine how each modality should influence cell similarity.
</p>

<p>
Clustering:
</p>

<p>
At some point, you cluster the data. To do this, you make a knn graph, and then do what is known as community detection (which regions of the graph are more connected and which regions are less connected), and assign clusters accordingly. You may have seen the words "Louvain" or "Leiden" in the tutorials. That is what this is.
</p>

<p>
Niche finding:
</p>

<p>
After you annotate the cells (e.g. labeling B cells, T cells, etc), you generally want to look for spatial "niches" that contain enrichment of specific cell types. To do this, you now make a neighbor graph of physical spatial coordinates so that each node is a cell label. You then do permutation tests (comparing to a randomized neighbor graph) to add statistical rigor.
</p>

<p>
Dimensionality reduction:
</p>

<p>
And finally, just about every single-cell publication has a t-SNE or UMAP these days. How do those work? To massively simplify, both methods take the cells, make respective constructs that are similar to a neighbor graph, and produce a 2D layout that preserves each cell's local relationships by minimizing an information theoretic "loss" (KL divergence for t-SNE, cross-entropy for UMAP) compared to the high-dimensional coordinates.
</p>

<p>
If you want to prove all of this for yourself, just go through Giotto's code base and search for terms like knn, neighbor, graph, and delaunay (see image below), and/or go to the original Giotto paper (link in comments) and search for "neighborhood network."
</p>

<p>
What does this mean for leaders and researchers alike?
</p>

<p>
Neighbor graphs help tie a lot of spatial analysis together. They are not the only thing you have to know, but you should get in the habit of finding these through lines and doubling down on them. This will allow you to both move fast and really understand what is happening under the hood.
</p>

<p>
If you want to talk to me more about any of this stuff, just send a DM. If you've been doing this a while and there are some other deep through lines you like (e.g. Fourier transform), please mention them in the comments. Otherwise, I hope you have a great day.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgba9f349">
<p>
Cluster stability as an evaluation metric for your clustering scheme's performance on single-cell data:
</p>

<p>
Here, I took the PBMC 3k dataset (from scRNA seq), and clustered it using the standard KNN graph-based clustering in Seurat with the default parameters (done on the top 10 principal components, not the UMAP). But then I did it multiple times over multiple random seeds. I then computed the centroids of each clustering and visualized them in UMAP plots. I then strung these together to run as an animation, which you can see in the image below.
</p>

<p>
I define cluster stability as the amount the clusters "move around" in subsequent clusterings. While I stop at the animations for this post, this metric can in turn be quantified using information theory metrics.
</p>

<p>
Here, we can see that the CD4 T cell subclusters are less stable than the rest of the clusters in the dataset. We already know that the T cells are harder to cluster for scRNA seq data, as compared to having data from an antibody panel (CITE-seq or flow/CyTOF), so this serves as a sanity check.
</p>

<p>
If you have a new data modality, or you're testing some new clustering algorithm, or you're simply optimizing whatever existing clustering scheme you've got, it might help to run it many times just to see whether the clusters are stable, or whether some clusters are more stable than others. This will help you optimize your clustering scheme and make sure that the populations that you end up selecting are not arbitrary.
</p>

<p>
Take home message for bioinformaticians:
</p>

<p>
Here is an evaluation metric (code is in the comments) that allows you to be a bit more sure about whatever clustering algorithm you are running on whatever dataset, to allow you to distinguish signal from noise and make you more confident with respect to what you end up using in downstream steps.
</p>

<p>
Take home message for leaders:
</p>

<p>
As the adage goes, what can be measured can be managed. For your research team, you want to be able to pepper in as many of these evaluation metrics as you can into your workflows. You already know that it helps if they are quantitative, but here I show that it helps if they are visual. The code in the comments will allow your team to produce these animations for your respective projects.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd4ab5e6">
<p>
In light of OpenAI's Deep Research, I updated my command line chatbot to include internet search. Armed with this feature, you can see a meta-level of prompt engineering involving "social networks" of chatbots, which I am calling prompt scripting. And you can do it today&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
At the simplest level, you have a chatbot that has a prompt. It outputs something, and its output gets fed into one or more chatbots that are pre-prompted to do a thing. The network of however many bots produce some final output in service of a higher goal.
</p>

<p>
You can do this by making a shell script, and storing the chatbot outputs as bash strings. If you know how to code, and can think algorithmically, this will serve you well here.
</p>

<p>
The simplest example is a newsletter producer (see the image):
</p>

<p>
Step 1: prompt a searchbot to give you research notes and sources around (for example) the latest updates in single-cell foundation models in the past 3 months.
</p>

<p>
Step 2: take the output from Step 1, and feed it into a reasoning model (eg. DeepSeek R1, or o3-mini-high) along with a prompt to produce a newsletter that contains footnotes and citations.
</p>

<p>
You can make this infinitely more complex. I have workflows where I pass a research prompt to searchbots that are pre-prompted to specialize in a particular sub-topic, all of which pass their output into a final report-producing bot, for example. You can have additional bots that take in the report and do something with it, or multiple "layers" of research bots. The possibilities are endless.
</p>

<p>
Again, you can do this today. Just go to my writeup (link in the comments). The code and instructions are spelled out. You need to sign up for perplexity and OpenRouter, and get respective API keys. At which point you can start to "play."
</p>

<p>
Finally, a prediction:
</p>

<p>
If you've ever used visual workflow tools like OMIQ or Scratch, I think this is what ChatGPT is going to look like down the line. Where you have a flowchart, where each node is a LLM that has a particular prompt, that passes output to other nodes, which are LLMs with a particular prompt. Have a look at LangGraph Studio if you want to see what I'm talking about.
</p>

<p>
One low hanging fruit here is UIs like this specific to your domain (for me: flow/CyTOF, single-cell and spatial). I can imagine a community where people share their agentic workflows that solve problems specific to their domain, or companies that have some complex workflow as part of their "moat."
</p>

<p>
So go build it, and tell me about it.
</p>

<p>
And to the rest of you, reach out if you need help configuring the tool or want to chat about related topics.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb3ee740">
<p>
In light of recent work on LLM-based single-cell annotation, I created a R function for you that allows you to integrate this into your workflow, and makes explicit how it works, so you can be empowered to develop things like this on your end without relying on high-level interfaces&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
The LLM:
</p>

<p>
I use OpenRouter, which gives me API access to the likes of GPT's, Claude, and DeepSeek without being locked into one vendor. You can use any of these if you use my tool. My function converts each cluster's output from Seurat's FindAllMarkers() into a string, which gets combined with a prompt fed into the LLM, per cluster. The output is a vector of annotated cell populations.
</p>

<p>
Results:
</p>

<p>
In this experiment, I used Claude 3.5 Sonnet on the back end. This tool was able to annotate the PBMC 3k dataset accurately, with errors involving depth of classification (eg. stopping at CD4 T, and not choosing naive or memory). Running the tool multiple times revealed wording changes (eg. CD4 T vs CD4+ T) but not changes in population guess.
</p>

<p>
Discussion:
</p>

<p>
Complexity of data: The PBMC datasets are simple and well-trodden. It is likely that LLM use will trip up in weird ways when we start looking at more complex data, like developmental trajectories or cancer.
</p>

<p>
Sophistication of model: Claude 3.5 Sonnet is a relatively good model at the time of writing, but we note that if this function trips up on more complex data, the user can switch to DeepSeek R1 or any of the other reasoning models for testing. Accuracy will likely get better as the models become more sophisticated. A future direction here is fine-tuning a model or using a model fine-tuned for the task of cell annotation (see my posts on foundation models).
</p>

<p>
Prompt engineering: The prompt is relatively straightforward, and there is room to play around with the prompt itself. One simple example might be to provide a document of examples of annotated cell types and what genes they express, directly as a pre-prompt. Such a document is increasingly more possible now, given all the single-cell "atlases" that are being constructed.
</p>

<p>
Try it yourself:
</p>

<p>
Use my tool (or similar ones). To use it, just get an OpenRouter API key. The rest is simply copying and pasting a block of code. Battle test it on your "real world data." Let me know where the model trips up. This will allow me and others working on similar things to figure out how to improve these things down the line.
</p>

<p>
Doing similar project on your end? Reach out. Plenty of people are talking about LLMs but few are actually doing work on them, and I would like to know who you are.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga0322ea">
<p>
If GSEA leaves you with firehose of GO and pathway terms that are hard to navigate, I've developed a free solution you can use that organizes and visualizes them by context, so you know what to do with them. Here is how it works:
</p>

<p>
The challenge:
</p>

<p>
GSEA (the category of tools that includes g:Profiler and the Broad's GSEA) produces a long list of terms that make it hard to see the "forest in the trees."
</p>

<p>
My approach:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Context mapping: I take the list of terms and feed them into a language embedding model, similar to BERT. This groups the terms spatially, so terms that are similar to each other in context are physically near each other in space.</li>

<li>Clustering and automated annotation: I then cluster the terms and use a LLM (directly in R) to annotate each cluster with an overarching theme derived from its constituent terms.</li>

<li>Interactive visualization: Finally, I produce a UMAP embedding from the results, and make it interactive such that you can hover over the data points and get the info you need.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Observations:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Groupings make sense: you can do a sanity check right on the interface to see that terms are grouping together in the map by context (eg. brain development).</li>

<li>LLM annotations make sense: I note however that they are not spot-on for every single term within a cluster, suggesting that increasing the resolution to the clustering might be a good idea.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Considerations and limitations:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>LLM output is slightly different each time: This is mainly the wording of the same underlying idea. As an example, one cluster was "Neurological and sensory system development" in one run, and "Developmental neurobiology" in another run. This goes back to my hypothesis that upping the resolution of the clusters will improve performance. Nonetheless, you should run the annotation step multiple times to check the consistency of the LLM output. I provide code for that accordingly.</li>

<li>My workflow preferences: I generally threshold by p-value, starting stringent and then loosening up. I also prefer pathway terms over GO terms.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Bottom line, for bioinformaticians and data scientists:
</p>

<p>
Read this markdown if you want to produce sensible visuals with the firehose of GO and pathway terms that you get asked to provide. From a technical standpoint, read this markdown if you want to:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>learn how to run a LLM directly in R</li>
<li>annotate clusters with it</li>
<li>run python in R</li>
<li>produce natural language embeddings</li>
<li>produce interactive maps</li>
</ul>

<p>
Bottom line, for leaders:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Utilizing recent developments in AI/ML to organize GSEA output (and any text-based output, broadly speaking) will allow you to see the big picture, save time on decision making, and make sure you don't miss anything.</li>

Why track LLM interactions?
</p>

<p>
When I am exploring a new dataset, I often will have questions around capabilities of specific packages, or how to do a thing in a specific language (eg. running plotly in R, which I typically do in python). I use LLMs for this, which frequently exposes me to new tools, packages, ways of structuring code, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
Because my analytical "flow state" can last for several hours, I want a record of exactly what I asked and what the model suggested at any given point. This helps me in terms of reproducibility, not only with respect to code, but also in terms of capturing my thought processes and the LLM feedback in the moment. Rather than flipping between interfaces, I'd much rather see the text, code, and LLM queries all in one notebook.
</p>

<p>
If down the line I'm sharing work with colleagues and collaborators, then I can include the LLM queries and responses as well, so they can understand how certain ideas and decisions took shape, if they were influenced by the LLM's suggestions. By bundling the conversation with my code and results, everyone has a complete picture of how we arrived at the final outcome.
</p>

<p>
How I did it:
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, I created a command line LLM caller that can be run by typing "chatbot" "your-llm-here" "your-prompt-here" in the command line. I use this primarily in literate programming environments (R Studio, Jupyter notebook, Org Mode) where I run a shell code block and type a query.
</p>

<p>
See the comments for a writeup exactly how to set this up on your end. Note that you'll be able to use Deepseek R1 if you do it like this.
</p>

<p>
On responsible LLM usage:
</p>

<p>
This is part of a bigger discussion around how we should responsibly use LLMs in our work. For me, what is important is tracking exactly how I was using them at exactly what step in my work, and exactly what output it gave me.
</p>

<p>
In terms of when I use them, my general litmus test is: if brain activity stays the same or goes up, I'm using them right. If brain activity goes down, I am using them wrong.
</p>

<p>
Note that unless you run these things fully locally, you should not put any proprietary information in here. This is not a problem for me, because I'm using them primarily to "expand my horizons" with respect to the analysis I already do. So it's more of a teacher than anything.
</p>

<p>
The bottom line
</p>

<p>
For the sake of keeping track of LLM use, you should have the ability to call and run LLMs directly from your jupyter notebooks or R markdowns, so you can see exactly how you were using them at all times.
</p>

<p>
Give it a shot, and message me if you need help setting it up. If you are integrating LLMs into your work in a unique way, let me know. I hope you all have a great day.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgcb9029e">
<p>
TL;DR: use the viridis color palette for your single-cell data to improve interpretability and colorblind accessibility. Flip through the 3-slide carousel for visuals. Longer post&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
It was brought to my attention in a previous post I made, that the "jet" color palette (blue -&gt; red) often used for coloring t-SNE and UMAP plots can exaggerate differences in marker values, and is not colorblind friendly.
</p>

<p>
In the R markdown linked in the comments, I compare the Jet, Seurat default, and Viridis palettes in terms of balance and colorblind friendliness. The report includes both color spectrum comparisons and UMAP plots colored using each palette, along with colorblind simulations.
</p>

<p>
The first image in the carousel shows the spectra in side by side comparisons. The second and third images show representative UMAPs colored in the three palettes along with their colorblind simulations.
</p>

<p>
Observations:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Jet: abrupt color transitions exaggerate small differences in marker expression if they occur at these transition points. Colorblind simulations keep these transitions and make the palette overall very unbalanced.</li>

<li>Seurat default: smooth transitions and colorblind friendly, but limited resolution due to fewer colors being used.</li>

<li>Viridis: smooth transitions and colorblind friendly, but with higher resolution due to more colors. This resolution is at least partially preserved in the colorblind simulations.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Based on these observations, I recommend that researchers and leaders consider using viridis (or palettes in the viridis family) as defaults for your papers, posters, talks, pitch decks, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
By doing so, we can enhance interpretability, inclusivity, and data literacy across academic and industry settings.
</p>

<p>
Please see the comments for a talk given at SciPy in 2015 from the creators of the viridis color palette. They do a great job introducing the viewer to the first principles of color theory, from the photons to the neurons. They use that in turn to explain the development of viridis.
</p>

<p>
Bottom line: use viridis to improve clarity and inclusivity in your single-cell data visualizations.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgd2cc972">
<p>
Flow/CyTOF users who are now doing single-cell sequencing analysis: I created the blue-to-red color palette (eg. used in FlowJo, Cytobank, OMIQ, etc) for Seurat's FeaturePlot function, which otherwise defaults to gray-to-purple.
</p>

<p>
Back in the early 2010s, when I was first coloring t-SNE maps for CyTOF data, I got used to a color palette that the main SAAS company in the space, Cytobank, was using. It's basically blue -&gt; cyan -&gt; green -&gt; yellow -&gt; orange -&gt; red.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, here is a R Markdown (linked in the comments) that has the code to use this color palette for FeaturePlot, but also some code that allows you to replicate the FeaturePlot function with the "Cytobank palette" independent of Seurat. The image is example output.
</p>

<p>
Feel free to steal the code and do whatever you want with it. I hope you all have a great day.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org77eca4a">
<p>
In a standard scRNA-seq analysis pipeline, you select the top ~2000 variable genes for downstream analysis (eg. clustering). However, my recent experiment suggests that you should not do this for foundation models. Here is what I did&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
The Universal Cell Embeddings (UCE) foundation model, part of a bigger "virtual cell" initiative, takes a raw cells x counts matrix as input and outputs a 1280 dimensional vector that contains biological meaning as output. This is then used for downstream analysis.
</p>

<p>
The power here is that you get the same vectors every time. There is no fine-tuning of the model. So you can make comparisons with any datasets that have never been run through the model, and therefore do things like annotate, given metadata cells from other datasets.
</p>

<p>
As I said in a previous post, this can take a long time if you're running it locally. One hypothesis, inspired by one of the comments, was that I could put in an abbreviated dataset of only variable genes, and get a faster result without sacrificing accuracy - a good thing when computational resources are limited.
</p>

<p>
Experimental design:
</p>

<p>
I ran the following 3 datasets through UCE.
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>The full dataset (positive control).</li>
<li>The dataset containing the most variable genes (experimental).</li>
<li>The dataset containing a random selection of genes (negative control).</li>
</ol>

<p>
My results:
</p>

<p>
I found that the dataset containing the most variable genes did not have the same level of cell type separation compared to the full dataset, with the negative control performing worse than both of them. This can be seen by assessing PCA space of the concatenated data (image below). Further quantification via Shannon entropy (to measure diversity) confirms this (see my jupyter notebook in the comments).
</p>

<p>
What this means for you:
</p>

<p>
This suggests that for UCE, and perhaps for other foundation models (geneformer, scGPT), you should run the full dataset through it to get the best results, and the typical practice of only selecting variable genes may not apply to the use of foundation models.
</p>

<p>
Zooming out:
</p>

<p>
There has been an uptick in people asking me questions around AI as it relates to single-cell in the past few weeks (perhaps because I'm posting about it). Even if you're a natural skeptic (like me), you should at least be familiar with them, because like the black boxes before it (eg. t-SNE/UMAP), these tools don't appear to be going anywhere. And they do indeed have potential to accelerate our workflows.
</p>

<p>
If you are doing work in this space, or interested in doing work in this space, please let me know.

<p>
Note: a pre-processing step in the UCE pipeline reduced the 1838 genes I took out in the experiment and control groups down to 1529 and 538 genes respectively. The 528 genes is fine because this is a negative control&#x2026;we are trying to get a situation where there is no cell separation. The 1529 genes (rather than around 1800) is a bit less than I'd otherwise use, and it is up to the reader to determine (and ideally experiment with their data) whether an additional 200-300 genes on the lower end of "most variable" would really bring it up to the standard of the full dataset.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2bfb9fb">
<p>
I test drove a single-cell AI foundation model with scRNA-seq data, so you don't have to. The punchline: it was good enough that I think you should familiarize yourself with these models. Here are the details&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
What I did:
</p>

<p>
The Universal Cell Embeddings (UCE) transformer-based foundation model takes the raw count matrix of scRNA-seq data, and outputs a 1280 dimensional vector per cell that is biologically meaningful (I know&#x2026;black box). Importantly, there is no standard pre-processing (find variable genes, normalizing, scaling, take the first n principal components). Just the raw counts as input.
</p>

<p>
I ran the flagship "PBMC 3k" dataset, along with a "PBMC 10k" dataset that they had as a default, through the 33-layer transformer model (there also a 4 layer option). On my laptop (14 inch MacBook Pro), these were essentially overnight runs. I tried running them through the day, but it slowed my computer down.
</p>

<p>
Observations:
</p>

<ol class="org-ol">
<li>Similar output to the old way: If we take the 1280 dimensional embeddings and visualize them with UMAP, the output looks similar to what I would otherwise see if I made a UMAP from the top n principal components of pre-processed data, per dataset. This suggests that the model is capturing similar information to what one would otherwise get from the standard Seurat/Scanpy pipelines.</li>

<li><p>
No direct data integration, but UMAP makes it look worse: When I concatenated the datasets and placed them onto the same UMAP (without integration), each dataset was on different sides of UMAP space, suggesting that the model didn't "grok" integration.
</p>

<p>
However, when I ran my KNN Sleepwalk tool on the UMAPs to look at the difference between UMAP space and high-dimensional model space, I found that the two datasets were much closer to each other than UMAP suggested. In other words, UMAP was exaggerating the space between them (see the image below).
</p></li>

<li>Not integrated, but aligned in PCA space: Further analysis in PCA space (see my jupyter notebook, very bottom) suggests that the two outputs are shaped such that you could literally "slide" one dataset onto the other.</li>
</ol>

<p>
The big picture:
</p>

<p>
The UCE model is the first model in the larger Virtual Cell initiative (link in comments), backed by the likes of Steve Quake, Aviv Regev, Stanford, and Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative. So there will be lots of resources directed at improving these models down the line.
</p>

<p>
I see a future where traditional pipelines and AI foundation models are run in parallel. This "barbell strategy" of old and new, combining standard approaches with AI pipelines, ensures we gain new insights without depending on black boxes.
</p>

<p>
A major hurdle here will be a speed-up. I had a hard enough time with 13,000 cells across two files. Real-world projects can be much larger.
</p>

<p>
In short, I would get familiar with these models now, before they start showing up in papers.
</p>

<p>
See my jupyter notebook detailing my work in the comments.
</p>

<p>
I hope you all have a great day.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org26e5e79">
<p>
In bioinformatics, sometimes the simple solution is good enough.
</p>

<p>
In a spatial transcriptomics project I'm on, I was researching tools for deconvoluting Visium data to get "pseudo-cell" info out of the "spots." Accordingly, pseudo-cells are inferred from transcriptomic profiles within Visium spots, which typically capture multiple cells. Deconvolution methods help break down these mixed profiles within the spots to estimate gene expression at a more granular, pseudo-cell level per spot.
</p>

<p>
In a benchmarking study to this end from the lab of Yvan Saeys, one thing stood out that I (and they) found interesting:
</p>

<p>
Of the 12 methods that were analyzed, a simple regression, known as non-negative least squares (NNLS) did better than almost half of these specialized spatial deconvolution tools in at least one metric, and did better than 1/3 of the methods in a composite score (see image below, which comes from Figure 2 of the paper).
</p>

<p>
The point I want to bring up here is that in some contexts the simple, rapidly implementable method, even if sub-optimal, is good enough. If you hypothetically had the first Visium dataset in human history and had to figure out a way to deconvolute it, this study shows that you would get pretty far just by running NNLS.
</p>

<p>
As another example you've seen if you follow my content, I got pretty far using k-nearest neighbors (KNN) to both quantitatively and visually benchmark nonlinear dimensionality reduction tools (before this topic was mainstream). There are many more methods out there to that end, but KNN is intuitive and easy to implement, so tools like this are a good place to start.
</p>

<p>
The take home message for leaders:
</p>

<p>
Agile decision making: when you're doing a first pass at something and/or when you're truly in the wild west (no one has written the book on what you're doing), a simple approach will get you insights more quickly, which will inform your next steps.
</p>

<p>
Resource (e.g. time) management: in projects with many moving parts, doing the most easily implementable things first will allow for a better handle on the problem space. This will help to determine if more sophisticated and time-consuming methods might be necessary down the line.
</p>

<p>
The take home message for scientists:
</p>

<p>
Momentum: in my experience, taking any action that moves the project forward, even if it's suboptimal, gives you psychological momentum (motivation) that moves you and the team forward. This is especially important for problems that are hard and intimidating. Just start somewhere.
</p>

<p>
The paper is linked in the comments, if you want to have a closer look. If I had to "benchmark" the benchmarking studies I've seen, the ones from the Saeys Lab are as good as they get.
</p>

<p>
I hope you all have a great day.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org401f4bd">
<p>
Plenty of people are talking about automation as the future of bioinformatics. This is fine, but there is one additional piece that leaders need to be aware of, to produce winning next-gen solutions: the user's paranoia.
</p>

<p>
A lot of the bioinformatics work I've done in the last 8 years has involved paranoia management, both for myself and for my clients. In other words, every last little piece of the workflow has checks and visual components to make sure there are no issues with the data and/or the algorithms (and believe me, issues come up). This is especially important when your analysis has any sort of novel component (data, tools used, etc).
</p>

<p>
There appears to be a push toward a "single button solution," be it auto-gating for flow/mass cytometry, or one-and-done cell segmentation in imaging. This is ok, but if you want buy-in from biologists, and especially clinicians (you do the data analysis wrong, bad things happen to sick people), you better have lots of "checks" at every step, both numeric and visual, so we can go through every last little piece of the analysis and look for things that could go wrong.
</p>

<p>
So embrace the paranoia of the users, learn about it, and speak to it as you build out the next generation of tools. We will thank you in the end.

I think that the spotlight on paranoia in my post resonates with a broader field, that may become increasingly relevant: explainable AI (XAI).
</p>

<p>
In section 2.3.1 of a 2024 review by Longo and colleagues (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1566253524000794">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1566253524000794</a>), highlighting the current challenges in XAI, paranoia is a subtext in the following life sciences related passage:
</p>

<p>
"The inferences produced by AI-based systems, such as Clinical Decision Support Systems, are often used by doctors and clinicians to inform decision-making, communicate diagnoses to patients, and choose treatment decisions. However, it is essential to adequately trust an AI-supported medical decision, as, for example, a wrong diagnosis can significantly impact patients."
</p>

<p>
(there is some paranoia that comes with getting clinical work right)
</p>

<p>
"In this regard, understanding AI-supported decisions can help to calibrate trust and reliance. For this reason, many XAI methods such as LIME, SHAP, and Anchors have been applied in Electronic Medical Records, COVID-19 identification, chronic kidney disease, and fungal or bloodstream infections"
</p>

<p>
(XAI methods serve as a number of visible checks to mitigate paranoia by identifying issues when AI is being used)

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orga11e8be">
<p>
When you cluster your single-cell data, do you run it multiple times to check for consistency? You should. This is part of an important topic called cluster stability. Let me explain.
</p>

<p>
The attached gif is FlowSOM clustering of CyTOF whole blood data, with 20 and 40 consensus clusters selected side by side, run 50 times. These are visualized on a UMAP. The cluster centroids from the UMAP visualization are computed and shown as yellow spots.
</p>

<p>
You'll notice that there are some instances where the centroids are relatively stable (especially in the 20 cluster case). There are other instances where they move, appear, disappear, and so on.
</p>

<p>
The practical takeaway I get from this is that if you're running FlowSOM or similar clustering algorithms where you choose the number of clusters, you should aim to over-cluster rather than trying to get the perfect number of clusters. You can always merge similar clusters later.
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, it helps to know which clusters are static versus which are moving around, in order to know whether a small "rare" cluster you found is a fluke that showed up one time in 50, or whether it keeps showing up.
</p>

<p>
The data and code for creating this gif is linked in the comments. I just got started on this project, and there is still some work to be done. Future directions include running this on clustering algorithms where the number of clusters are actually computed rather than chosen, like PhenoGraph. If we find that these clusters are moving around all over the place, then it will be worth doing a one-over on relevant clustering strategy.

<p>
Facing challenges with analyzing large flow and mass cytometry datasets?
</p>

<p>
As datasets grow, the need for faster and more efficient tools becomes paramount. If you're looking to run FlowSOM clustering on more cells faster, consider exploring GigaSOM in the Julia programming language:
</p>

<p>
🚀 It clustered 1.1 billion cells in just under 25 minutes (EmbedSOM image below).<br />
🖥️ Achieved on a relatively small (256 core) compute cluster.<br />
</p>

<p>
While I haven't done a side-by-side comparison with this exact dataset on this size compute cluster in R, my experience with Julia has been promising. It combines the ease of R and Python with the speed of a lower-level language.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org739c97b">
<p>
I wanted to highlight a clustering method specialized in rare subset detection that in my opinion is under-explored with respect to newer, high dimensional data types (eg. single cell sequencing, high-dimensional imaging, spectral flow). It's called X-Shift, written by Nikolay Samusik.
</p>

<p>
For biologists and directors, if you have any projects that involve the detection of rare cell subsets, then X-shift should be on your radar. X-shift was determined to be the best method for rare cell subset detection, in a 2016 clustering method benchmarking study (the one that put FlowSOM on the map). The paper is linked in the markdown below.
</p>

<p>
Why isn't X-shift all over the place? The method is computationally expensive (eg. high run-times), and runs in Java, not the more common R or Python (yet), making it more difficult to integrate into existing single-cell pipelines. Thus, the method is not as widely utilized and explored as it otherwise would and should be.
</p>

<p>
How does it work? The method is based on mean-shift clustering. For each cell, move in the direction of higher density until you get to a peak. That peak is your cluster.
</p>

<p>
For bioinformaticians (and anyone else interested in going deep), I created a massively simplified, hyper-tailored, and highly visual version of X-shift in R, to ground your intuition in how it works. You can see the method in action, code and all, in this markdown: <a href="https://lnkd.in/e_mSEzm3">https://lnkd.in/e_mSEzm3</a>. In the markdown, I include links to the X-shift paper, benchmarking study, and X-shift software.
</p>

<p>
Thank you for your attention, and I hope you all have a great day.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org82b5e2a">
<p>
The following is a warning for biologists, bioinformaticians, and leaders of research teams, especially those moving from a flow/CyTOF background into single-cell sequencing. Please study the concept of data integration.
</p>

<p>
Flow and CyTOF users know to cluster on "type" markers (eg. surface), and never on "state" markers (eg. phospho-proteins). However, making this distinction is not possible for scRNA seq data. Thus, we have to rely on data integration, which is a way of algorithmically "aligning" data across multiple conditions.
</p>

<p>
Here, I show how integration is done, but my main point is to show what the data look like when they're not integrated. Failure to integrate the data can lead to false conclusions, and a whole lot of wasted time and effort.
</p>

<p>
For biologists and leaders of research teams, please study these pictures. You need to know what un-integrated data look like so you can have intuition around what is a novel cell subset and what is a technical artifact.

</p>

I have not come across any work using LLMs particularly with flow/CyTOF data analysis (comment or DM me if you have), though I have seen a few papers using them in single-cell sequencing analysis, suggesting that flow/CyTOF might be next.

Automated gating (autogating) has been a topic of discussion for many years, but more recently I'm seeing it in the major flow/cytof analysis SaaS products, and I'm hearing of users requesting it more often. So I am interested in knowing whether it is becoming a standard part of people's workflows, whether there's simply more interest, or whether most people are not interested and there is a selection bias in what I'm seeing.

Trends in the literature. There is a lot going on here, and very few people actually studying this. Given the <a href="https://gwern.net/replication">replication crises</a> that are emerging in various fields, it is probably a good idea that more people pay attention to analyzing the literature itself in the single-cell field.

<p>
Keeping ahead of the single-cell foundation model literature, using GitHub's "awesome" pages:
</p>

<p>
Foundation models are AI models that, after being trained on a large amount of relevant data, can serve as a "swiss army knife" to perform a number of tasks (eg. cell type annotation).
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, these are creating a bit of a buzz in single-cell and spatial analysis, and people should have a thumb on what is going on in this space. But like any popular emerging field, it can be hard to stay on top of all the new work&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
For those interested in keeping up with progress in foundation models, look no further than GitHub's "awesome" pages. This one (link in comments), called awesome-foundation-model-single-cell-papers, contains lists of papers in the following categories:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>foundation model evaluation for single-cell</li>
<li>foundation models for single-cell (includes spatial papers like nicheformer)</li>
<li>foundation models for genetic perturbation</li>
<li>foundation models for pathology</li>
</ul>

<p>
The papers are ordered in each category, with the most recent papers being at the top.
</p>

<p>
In essence, there are many more papers in this domain than I previously appreciated. I started with scGPT and moved to Universal Cell Embeddings, which I have posted about on here previously. Others in my network are using geneformer. There were a handful of others in the benchmarking efforts I saw.
</p>

<p>
But on this page, I counted 78 papers that go back to 2022.
</p>

<p>
A simple CTRL+F for "review" revealed only two papers. Additional context in the titles reveal two more review-like papers, bringing the upper limit to 4. This would suggest that review articles would be a low hanging fruit for those publishing in this space.
</p>

<p>
A caution:
</p>

<p>
Like any field that is "hot," along with all the imperfections we know about in terms of publication (replication crisis, the jupyter notebook issue that I posted about recently), the work here needs to be taken with a grain of salt.
</p>

<p>
What I'm doing right now:
</p>

<p>
First, I am trying to understand these models from first principles (more in the comments).
</p>

<p>
What has helped me is the simple act of running these models on my data to see what actually is used as input and what comes out. I will link to some of that work in the comments. Otherwise I would visit this page every once in a while to get an idea for where this is going. This will become easier as UIs start to allow for low-code/no-code use. If you want a taste of this from an adjacent domain, do a google search for "AlphaFold Server."
</p>

<p>
Things like supervised label transfer between datasets are being discussed in my circles, a direct application of these foundation models. So like UMAP, I don't think this is going away any time soon.
</p>

<li>What is coming out?</li>

<p>
There are a handful of concepts here that intersect with stuff any single-cell researcher would already know. For instance, the output is often a high-dimensional embedding. So things like the curse of dimensionality, distance metrics, dimensionality reduction and its limits, and so forth are relevant here too. If you've ever used BERT (as opposed to a GPT), you have a leg up too.

If we put 2008 as the first CyTOF paper (from Scott Tanner, before Garry Nolan), CyTOF hit 100 publications in 2017, or 9 years. If we put 2014 as the first Imaging Mass Cytometry (IMC) paper, then IMC reached 100 publications in 2022, or 8 years.

For some reason, I didn't think IMC was taking off as fast, but that might be because I witnessed the increase in CyTOF popularity while in the Nolan Lab.

Spectral flow cytometry is trending in my circles, but this isn't reflected in the publication trends (yet). My analysis puts the spectral publication rate per year closer to that of CITE-seq than CyTOF. I (probably a lot of us) predict a spike in a few years. Until then, pre-print and relevant social media trends might be more informative.

My fear right now is that we are in the middle of a replication crisis, across many bioinformatics-dependent domains. What do we do about it?
</p>

<p>
Education: all of us who can analyze data know a little corner of it better than the rest of us. We all have something to teach. It's not necessarily about turning biologists and leaders into bioinformaticians. Not everyone wants that. It's more about bioinformatic literacy. Knowing the concepts. Knowing the lingo. Having intuition.
</p>

<p>
Funding and policy: I am disheartened by the number of labs that are underserved in bioinformatics. Plenty of labs need a FTE bioinformatician and are stuck borrowing the one in the adjacent lab for a few hours here and there. Why? Is it due to underestimating how much grant funding will be needed for bioinformatics, for a given project? Is it due to limits as to how much a grant agency will fund bioinformatics needs for a given project? This is more of an open question on my end, but I think it's worth getting into. (This is a sensitive topic, so feel free to DM me about this one).
</p>

<p>
Skepticism: At the beginning of grad school, we would read old seminal papers in our fields and spend an hour picking them apart. This was easier to do when it was western blots. Now, who has the time to look critically at the complex methods, the code and raw data (if these are even provided, see anything posted by Mike Leipold)? This includes the reviewers. I'm hoping that a bit more bioinformatic literacy will allow us to do this better.
</p>

<p>
In short, this is a complicated problem space, with a lot hinging on it. But I hope the three things above serve as a good starting point.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org7bc00c9">
<p>
Ever wonder what regions of "news space" are more CNN-heavy or more FoxNews-heavy? It turns out that you can get at this by using large language models to convert news article titles into spatial coordinates. I did this for a mix of CNN, Fox, and AP news articles from their respective twitter handles, but you do this analysis for any source.
</p>

<p>
While I thought that each little subregion of the map (topic) would have a CNN and a Fox cluster, with AP somewhere in the middle, it turns out that Fox really doubles down on particular topics (eg. politics). Yellow in the image corresponds to Fox-heavy regions. Even AP has its its little pockets. Have a look yourself. The article title pops up with every point you hover over. If you don't like to see code, just scroll to the bottom where the plots are. Go here: <a href="https://lnkd.in/eHG3w4Ef">https://lnkd.in/eHG3w4Ef</a>
</p>

<p>
Technical explanation for those who care: I used the sentence-transformers python library to convert each article into a 768 dimensional vector. I kept within a particular date range and randomly sub-sampled until the number of articles were equal across the three sources. I then found the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) of each data point in the high-dimensional space. I then calculated various measures, from per-KNN fraction CNN/Fox/AP to per-KNN Shannon Entropy. I then did UMAP on the data and colored the UMAP by the KNN measures that I did.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgeafa300">
<p>
I recently hit a milestone in my personal journal: one million words over 15 years. To review it all, I embedded each paragraph into what I call "thought space."
</p>

<p>
I found four key words that seem to partition the majority of thought space: business, science, family, and philosophy (see picture). The term "health" in turn bridged these four terms. The data suggest that at least when I sit down to write, health is on my mind, through whichever of the aforementioned lenses. I can confirm that health is at or near the top of my general value system. Everything is done with health in mind, for myself and for those close to me.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgecf4c03">
<p>
The retweet-to-like ratio matters for getting value out of twitter for your niche, to the point where you might be able to draw manual gates on the likes x retweets biaxials. For single-cell sequencing related tweets, I find three regions:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>High retweets/likes: open academic student and postdoc positions</li>
<li>Medium retweets/likes: papers, projects, data</li>
<li>Low retweets/likes: memes, status updates</li>
</ul>

<p>
Knowing this can save you time whether you're looking for a new position, or trying to find the latest impactful papers. This is a work in progress, and things might differ by subject (eg. CyTOF, microbiome, AI).
</p>

<p>
If you're curating tweets for your particular niche, I recommend looking at the retweets and likes biaxial (note the log scale) to determine the regions that give you the most value.
</p>

<p>
In a way, it's no different than gating on FSC x SSC or DNA x event<sub>length</sub>.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgb17753b">
<p>
My TEDx Basel talk is now out! Here are a few key takeaways:
</p>

<p>
If you ever struggle with being emotionally hi-jacked by and/or addicted to the infinite scroll of your feeds (including LinkedIn), you're not alone. I note that my ADHD brain is especially vulnerable, and this can perhaps be said of a huge number of other neurodivergencies.
</p>

<p>
The infinite scroll is not the only way we can take in information. It may be optimally profitable (especially with the AI recommendation algorithms), but I show in some of the software that I've developed, that there are other ways.
</p>

<p>
None of this is going to just go away, unless perhaps it is replaced by something even more addictive. I think better ways to take in information and connect with each other will come from a community-driven, open-sourced effort. It needs to be optimized toward something other than attention and profit.
</p>

<p>
Thank you to everyone at TEDxBasel for giving me the opportunity to give this talk, and coaching me through the process. I'm a much better speaker now thanks to you, especially my coaches Cinzia Donato and Beril Esendal. Also leaders/coaches Beatriz Graça, Joanna Duda, Sara Laudato, and Smitha Rose Kariapuram, and everyone else who volunteered to make the event happen.
</p>

<p>
Thank you to my fellow speakers who provided feedback and support through the process. We did it, and you all were amazing! This includes Jo Filshie Browning, Bert te Wildt, Ben Meyer, Flavio Donato, Daniele Diana, Marcel Barelli, Reto Odermatt, and Mary Meaney.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3d5e858">
<p>
In flow/mass cytometry, we spend a lot of time on panel design. It turns out if you're going to run a spatial transcriptomic assay (e.g. Xenium), panel design is critical too. Let me explain&#x2026;
</p>

<p>
The following information comes from a trusted colleague who runs a high-volume Xenium core, and has seen a lot. My general interest in this comes from an increase in spatial work (and the pain points therein) that has come my way recently.
</p>

<p>
As a preliminary step, it helps to have prior annotated scRNA seq analysis on hand. This can inform what genes you select in the Xenium panels. Accordingly, you have to select markers that can confidently distinguish between cell types/clusters.
</p>

<p>
If you want to do exploratory work, then something like Visium might be a better idea, given that it covers closer to the whole transcriptome. The downside here, of course, is you don't get the single-cell resolution. I've been helping with a project for almost a year involving trying to get "pseudo-cell" info out of each of the spots. In other words, Xenium has its place.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, the emphasis on panel design might be changing in the near future due to a Xenium 5000-plex assay that recently came out, presumably because enough people were complaining about the low-plex (300-500 genes) that you'd otherwise get from Xenium at default. I am not familiar with all the methods in the space, but I would guess that others are going to be moving in this direction too.
</p>

<p>
Assuming the higher-plex assays produce high-quality data, this points to a future where you have a few more markers to play around with.
</p>

<p>
But until this is widespread and widely validated, I would budget some time into carefully designing your Xenium panels (and panels for related methods), and doing the necessary preliminary experiments (scRNA-seq) accordingly.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1fd9dbe">
<p>
The following is for my friends from academia who are in a tough work and/or financial situation. I was living on the paycheck at the end of grad school (2016), when I started doing bioinformatics consulting on the side. This got me out of my financial woes. I kept this up after graduation until I transitioned to full-time self-employed consulting starting in 2018. I haven't stopped, and you can do it too. Here are three things that have kept me in business the past several years.
</p>

<p>
A robust network of people who like and trust you.<br />
My first engagement came from a conversation I overheard from a former lab-mate, whose company was looking for consultants. My second engagement was through a colleague and close friend of mine. Many subsequent engagements have been through connections, and/or previous clients who know and trust my work.
</p>

<p>
A high standard of excellence.<br />
Many of my clients are re-signs, meaning I've worked with them before. Every once in a while, I'll get an email from an old client who has a new problem that I'm a fit to solve. Many of my other clients are long-term engagements, and in non-employment work when they can cut you at any time with a few days warning, long-term only happens when you do good work.
</p>

<p>
Give, give, give.<br />
I was on a sales call once, where I essentially solved the problem on the call so they didn't need to pay me. They came back a few months later with paid work. This also goes with passing around leads (prospective clients). If I know I can't do what's needed, I often know who can. It's not about how much I can make, it's about how much I can give.
</p>

<p>
I don't expect three bullet points on a LinkedIn post to lead to my friends suddenly becoming consultants&#x2026;it's a long process. Rather, I'd like everyone (especially in academia) to know that this alternative path is possible, either a few hours a week to make ends meet, or as a full-time endeavor. Accordingly, if you orient toward this path as early as you can, then perhaps you'll get an opportunity down the line that can cascade into something bigger.
